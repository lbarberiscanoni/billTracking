South Carolina is notorious for its history of prejudice and hate-driven crimes, and according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there are 19 known hate groups in the state. Increased penalties for hate crimes not only deter smaller crimes such as vandalism or harassment, but according to a study done by the Anti-Defamation League, victims are more likely to report hate crimes if they know there will be a consequence. This bill will create harsher penalties for any misdemeanors or felonies classified as hate crimes. <h3>Section</h3> 2: A hate crime is defined as a crime committed with clear intent to harm a person or property due to their race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, or sexual orientation. If someone is found guilty of a hate crime, they will be subjected to a fine of 2,000 to 10,000 dollars, and/or a prison sentence of two years to life, depending on the severity of the crime. Additionally, all law enforcement agencies will be required to report any and all hate crimes to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). <h3>Section</h3> 3: States with laws such as this in place have not experienced large increases in prison sentences, refuting the argument that such laws would lead to additional costs or prison bloating. Instead, penalties for hate crimes lead to reduced overall crime and higher consequences for petty crimes that contribute to racist and damaging ideals. Any additional costs due to extended prison sentences will be covered by fines collected from criminal offenders. <h3>Section</h3> 4: This bill will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). <h3>Section</h3> 5: Once signed into law, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Penalize Hate Crimes","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsRVucy6yAiOdOmnF","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops working due to a malfunction of electrical impulses, which can result in brain damage and death if not treated immediately. In these life-threatening situations, time is everything. A person whose oxygenated blood supply to the brain has been stopped can suffer brain damage within minutes and death in eight to ten minutes. The average first responder response time is eight to twelve minutes and every minute help is delayed a persons chance of survival decreases by ten percent. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Due to the small window of time, people must be able to react immediately and know the skills necessary to attempt to save a persons life. CPR, or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, is not only useful in these situations, it is also useful in heart attacks or some near drowning instances, in which a persons heart has stopped. Additionally, knowledge of how to use an AED, or automated external defibrillator, increases the chances of survival in situations where the victim's heart needs to be returned to a normal rhythm. In combination, these skills can save the life of a person in need. <h3>Section</h3> 3: A. In order to provide as many people as possible with these skills, this bill requires all high school students to take a course on performing CPR and AED usage. The course will be a part of the Physical Education curriculum.  B. Exemptions will be available for students with whose IEP or 504 states that he/she is not able to perform the tasks required in the course. Additionally, a doctors note advising of health problems that would cause an inability to perform the tasks required can exempt the student.  C. The district school board shall use an instructional program developed by the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, another nationally recognized program that teaches the most current CPR and AED methods, or a local medical professional, EMS, or other adult certified to teach the most current information by the American Red Cross.  D. This bill will affect all public high school students, beginning with the class of 2020. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Each school board will be responsible for the funding of their teaching method of choice. As long as the program complies with the guidelines set forth in <h3>Section</h3> 3, the district may choose whatever program is best for them financially and logistically. <h3>Section</h3> 5: As stated in <h3>Section</h3> 3, the class will be a mandatory addition to the Physical Education Program. This class is a graduation requirement in South Carolina. Failure to successfully complete this training will result in the withholding of the credit until the student completes the course. The certified instructor will determine if a student passes the training based on the most current standards.

This is roughly an average of $12,000 in business taxes and $4,300 in income taxes. This bill would allow new small businesses to be exempted from paying any taxes for one year after they open their business in the State of South Carolina, and their owners would be exempted from paying income taxes for one year. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  As stated by the United States Department of Labor, 80% of small businesses fail within the first 18 months. This bill would cut the taxes stated above to 0% for the first year after a business opens, and would exempt the business owner from paying income tax for the first year. According to financial analysts, a proposal like this would save the average small business owner in SC roughly $20,000 in taxes. It also predicts that this would raise the rate of small-businesses in the State of South Carolina by roughly 20%, adding at least $50,000,000 to our state revenue, within the first 3 years of this bill being enacted. This is supported by financial analysts, but also by former projections when South Carolinas economy grew by 3.4% in two years with a 3% decrease in overall taxes. This bill would allow many people in poorer areas of the state to make their dreams come true and open a small business while focusing on paying their lease or rent and building a client base. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  We will grow the economy by allowing more businesses to stay-open with the money saved from the decrease in taxes. We would also benefit as we would take the top ranking for Business Insiders best states for small business, which would help grow our population in addition to 4.5% growth we already experience. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  Overall provisions for this bill:   Small businesses would be tax exempt for one year after opening.   Owners would be exempt from income taxes for one year.   After the one year is up, they will pay 50% of the tax rate the second year, and will then return to pay the original taxes the third year.   Small business that pay their workers over $10.00 an hour will be given subsidies in an attempt to raise wages in the state.   The overall revenue gained would go towards infrastructure, education, and a government sponsored organization that helps create small businesses. <h3>Section</h3> 5: When signed into law, this new tax policy will go into effect on April 15th, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Allow New Small Businesses and Their Owners to be Tax Exempt for One Year after Opening","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsSAmlu2XQul9idow","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"Eastside High School","sponsor":" "},"-K3JsSLl0QFE1MawWayZ":{"author1":"Shelby Askins","author2":"Cristina Waingart","authorLocation":"not yet assigned","billLocation":"F","billStatus":"on the docket","billText":"<h3>Section</h3>1: Currently, in the state of South Carolina, there is no program available for students to have access to information missed in the classroom. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  When a student is absent from class, important information can be lost amongst the multitude of makeup work received when returning to school. Students also miss information in the class due to distractions and other mishaps. The recording of lessons will allow absent students to have the same teaching as if they were in classroom. Students who are misinformed or confused can access the teachings to provide clarity. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  Every classroom is required to have a live recording of the teaching for that day. The teacher will have a microphone; it will act as a remote that can turn the recording on and off, so that students can listen in on the lesson. The student will be able to watch the presentation using an application that allows a visual of the board with a podcast of the lesson. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  The program will only be accessed by students who have a school-provided student identification and password.

The applicant must pass a mandatory drug test. They must meet a legal age limit of 18 years. Persons that sign up for a license permit themselves to undergo mandatory STI tests on a weekly basis. Condoms are required to be worn by all male prostitutes and customers. A recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health reveals that of the combined 3,290 clients of forty different legal sex workers, not one received penetrative sex without a condom. This information contrasts greatly with the realities of street prostitution. Women working without the protection of brothel management are often intimidated or forced to perform these same services without the benefit of safeguards for their health. Persons that believe that they have contracted an STI from a prostitute may press charges if they provide sufficient evidence that they received the STI while obtaining the services from the brothel in question, and vice-versa. Prostitutes may only work within the confines of brothel in which they are employed. If any rules and regulations are not followed, licenses will be suspended until all rules and regulations are met. If standards are not met within a certain period of time, licenses will be revoked. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Businesses must be licensed in order to become a brothel. To acquire a license, a business must pay a licensing fee. The license will only allow for a certain amount of prostitutes to be employed at any one time. The price of the license will rise incrementally as the amount of prostitutes employed rises. Brothels are subjected to random checks from the Health Department annually. <h3>Section</h3> 5: The commercial licensing fee would be 100,000 dollars annually.

This is done through recommendation by the South Carolina Judicial Merit Selection Committee. In fact, other than Virginia, South Carolina is the only state to appoint judges based solely on legislative election, putting too much power in the legislature. Furthermore, of the 170 current members of the General Assembly, fifty, or around thirty percent, are active attorneys and thus argue cases in front of the justices that they chose to elect. This creates a political climate in which justices can become biased and thus make rulings not by evidence presented but by whichever legislator is arguing the case so that they will be reelected at the expiration of their term. <h3>Section</h3> 2: This bill will change the election of justices instead to slightly mirror the federal system to resolve the potential bias and imbalance within the current system. Thus, justices will be nominated by the acting Governor and subsequently approved by the South Carolina Judicial Merit Selection Committee. Then, the Governor's nomination will be confirmed by a simple majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Also, because this is simply a reform measure within the government to alleviate a corruption issue, there would be no need for funding or expenditure from the government. The reason we decided upon a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly is simply because a two-thirds majority is difficult to attain, which would still lead to justices having to appease legislators to get elected. With a simple majority, a consensus is more easily reached, alleviating justices with the pressure to appease certain legislators. Also, if the General Assembly rejects a judicial candidate, then that candidate is taken off of the ballot for the position since the Governor has no veto power in South Carolina, except for bills concerning budget. Thus, the legislature's decision is final. <h3>Section</h3> 4: As this bill is meant to curb judicial corruption, the bias and dependency of justices regarding specific legislators should decrease. However, the South Carolina Commission on Judicial Conduct is still responsible to seek out bias amongst justices, as it was designed to do, and administer punishment and trial as necessary. <h3>Section</h3> 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Change the Nomination and Election of South Carolina Judges","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsWFJ7eKqWt2jINLh","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"Hammond School","sponsor":" "},"-K3JsWQ2vl5-OCVEx-HJ":{"author1":"Caroline Zeller","author2":"Colleen Goff","authorLocation":"not yet assigned","billLocation":"B","billStatus":"on the docket","billText":"<h3>Section</h3>1: Any person found to be wearing an obnoxious amount of perfume and/or cologne will be fined. <h3>Section</h3> 2: To ease the sufferings of people with asthma and/or allergies, to keep the air clean of toxins similar to non smoking laws.
