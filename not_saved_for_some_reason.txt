{'school': 'J.L. Mann High School', 'title': 'Motorcycle Helmet Law', 'text': '<h3>Section</h3>1: An act to make riding a motorcycle illegal without the use of a helmet. There has been a safety problem in South Carolina with motorcycle accidents. Our bill is to help the safety of a motorcyclist and save many lives. This bill will make the safety of a rider much greater than it was before. <h3>Section</h3> 2: More than 80 percent of motorcyclist crashes result in injury or death to the rider. The statistics show that helmets reduce the risk of death to a motorcyclist by 37 percent. Helmets also have been statistically shown to reduce head injury by 69 percent to the rider. The United States saved $3 billion dollars due to the helmet use in 2010 due to less deaths and crashes to clean up.  Also, if all riders would have worn helmets, the United States could have saved an addition $1.4 billion dollars in 2010. However, helmets do not reduce visibility or impair hearing. (iihs.org) <h3>Section</h3> 3: This bill will not have to have much of a fund. The only fund would be that riders would have to buy helmets at their own expense. If a rider chooses not to wear a helmet then the rider will be breaking the law and possibly face future tickets, fines, and/or jail time. <h3>Section</h3> 4: This bill will be enforced by law enforcement in South Carolina. The offense of not wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle would be a ticket enforced by police officers. The result of not following this law could result in heavy fines and possibly prison time. The first time will result in a $500 fine. The second offense would result in another $500 fine and 30 days in prison. Any other offenses after this will result in jail time determined by a judge. <h3>Section</h3> 5: This bill will go into effect once signed by the governor at the date of June 8th, 2016.', 'number': 'PS30', 'sponsor': 'Vignesh Rajmohan and Cameron Murr', 'committee': 'PB', 'authors': 'Heath Schoen Sam Fuqua', 'originates': 'Premier Senate'}


{'school': 'J.L. Mann High School', 'title': 'An Act to Teach High School Students About Domestic Violence', 'text': '<h3>Section</h3>1: All public schools will be required to introduce a three part domestic violence curriculum within grade ninth to twelfth year, during a health or PE class. Domestic Violence is a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence. Other terms for domestic violence include intimate partner violence, battering, relationship abuse, spousal abuse, or family violence. <h3>Section</h3> 2: The purpose of this bill is to educate students about domestic violence in order to reduce the domestic violence rate. Safe Harbor, a supporter of this bill, is a special program in South Carolina for victims of domestic violence, helping, sheltering, counseling, and supporting them. Currently, there is no policy for a curriculum for domestic violence, which is why it needs to be taught among the teenagers. <h3>Section</h3> 3: The curriculum for the three part domestic violence curriculum will be provided by the state department of education. The domestic violence curriculum will be taught through the health and physical education classes, when the student takes a health or physical education class. The curriculum will be taught for two weeks to prevent interruption of other gym priorities. Students should learn in the curriculum to tell an adult if domestic violence occurs, know what domestic violence is, and ways to prevent it from happening. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Domestic Violence is a continuous growing problem in the state of South Carolina, and it must be addressed to our teenagers to help decrease the percentage. South Carolina is the second state in the nation with the highest percentage of men killing women. <h3>Section</h3> 5: The domestic violence curriculum provided by the state department and the program Safe Harbor. The classes will equal three one hour units which will be taught one hour for three consecutive days. If students take this class, who are not in a PE or Health class, they will be allowed to have special privileges, with the guidelines of the students school. Although this is not a required grade to graduate, it is a required grade to pass a PE or health class. Also, learning about domestic violence is a must among teenagers, and it will help benefit their knowledge and decrease the domestic violence rate. <h3>Section</h3> 6: This bill shall go into effect August 18th, 2016 upon the passage and signature of the Youth Governor.

Mann High School', 'title': 'An Act to REQUIRE ALL TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES TO BE MARKED', 'text': "<h3>Section</h3>1: All traffic enforcement officers cars will be required to be marked so that any civilian will without a doubt be able to identify the officer. Any police officer assigned to traffic enforcement will be required to have a fully marked car. The side doors and the hood of the police car need to bear the agency's badge or the city seal, as well as emergency telephone numbers. This will not affect law enforcement such as detectives. <h3>Section</h3> 2: The purpose of this bill is to help with traffic flow and the continuous issue of speeding on busy roads. When civilians are able to identify a police officer on the road, they tend to slow down. This will help cut the amount of wrecks caused by speeding. <h3>Section</h3> 3: The required markings of each car will be provided by money gathered from state highway taxes. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Requiring marked cars will not only help to identify officers, but will cut down on the amount of civilians speeding.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLTED

An Act to Increase the Number of College Graduates

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current GPA required for a college student to maintain the LIFE scholarship is 3.0, would be decreased to 2.5.

Section 2: The lowered GPA of 2.5 would allow more students to graduate from college that would otherwise consider dropping out of college when they lose their scholarship. This will increase the amount of citizens in South Carolina getting their degree and getting higher paying jobs.

Section 3: Many schools in the state of South Carolina do not properly prepare students for college. South Carolina landed 37 spots on the list of the top 100 worst schools in the Nation. When students that attend these schools that don’t properly equip them with the skills and knowledge to be successful begin college, they quickly lose the 3.0 GPA that got them the scholarship. These hardworking students are then in danger of losing the $2,500 scholarship given to them for their good grades. Without this scholarship, many students have to   out of college because they no longer have the finances to pay for college. By lowering the GPA to 2.5 we give these students a little room to make mistakes and get the feel for a college workload. More students will be able to keep the scholarship this way which will increase the number of college graduates in the state of South Carolina. This would increase the number of functioning members in society; these graduates will be paying money to the government rather than receive a check from the government every month.

Section 4: The benefit from this tax would be:
	•	The number of college dropouts would decrease.
	•	Increase the number of people receiving college degrees and working higher paying jobs.
	•	Fewer people working minimum wage jobs and receiving welfare.

Section 5: When signed into law, the GPA requirement will go into effect for the 2016-17 schoolyear.

This program will outline a set of guidelines to create safe envrronments for these refugees to stay. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  In this program , citizens who agree to house a refugee, or a family of refugees will be considered a host family, and will receive $13.70 a day per adult, and $6.85 a day per child to provide the necessities needed for the refugee(s) . <h3>Section</h3> 3: In the saving families program, it will provide the necessities to refugees. Citizens of South Carolina can volunteer to house a refugee , or a family of refugees. The citizens who agree to house and provide for the refugees will receive $13.70 a day per adult, and $6.85 a day per child. That totals to $2500 for a six month period per adult, and $1250 for a six month period per child. The United States State Department is allowing 85,000 refugees in 2016 entrance into the United States, and last year 2050 refugees located to South Carolina, so based on these numbers this program helps to increase the number of refugees located in South Carolina to 3000 refugees in 2016 and future years. The employees needed to run this program will be hired and paid for by the South Carolina Department of Human Services. The money host families are given to provide for the refugees will be funded by the South Carolina lottery. To become a host family the citizen will have to go through an extensive background check, and prove they have healthy living conditions, necessary transportation , and financial stability. A host family will be provided government money for six months, and are expected to house, and care for the refugee(s) for six months, after that amount of time it is up to the family whether or not to continue care for the refugees.

Section 2: The NFL Super Bowl is one of the most watched televised sporting events globally. Following the Super Bowl, workplaces undergo unplanned absences from their employees, making the costs for those absences about 50% more expensive than those of planned absences. Any employees that do end up present at their workplace the Monday after the Super Bowl end up incredibly distracted from work, either because of discussing the events of the night before, or being hungover. Students that stay up late and go to school the next day will be sleep deprived, and also most likely to discuss the game. Hence, they will not be able to mentally focus on any of their subjects.  Section 3: Making the Monday following the Super Bowl into a public holiday will prevent any more costs for absences at the workplace. Research shows that out of 147.4 million American workers, 1.5 million are expected to call in sick on Super Bowl Monday , and 4.4 million could go in late. There would also be close to a loss of $170 million in productivity. These drawbacks would affect every state within North America. If the following Monday were made a public holiday, then the problem of unorganized and distracted work and school environments would be avoided, especially considering the already great loss of productivity.  Section 4: When signed into law, it will officially go into effect on the Monday following the next Super Bowl and continue to be in effect for every following post-Super Bowl Monday.

text:		<h3>Section</h3>I: South Carolinas Department of Motor Vehicles will be affected, and state roads and highways will be impacted. <h3>Section</h3> II: Out of all males between the ages of 15-20, who had been involved in fatal crashes in 2012, 37% were speeding at the time of the crash and 25% had been drinking. South Carolina is ranked as the state with the highest fatality rate on the road. In addition, fatal crashes are the leading cause of death for US teens. Clearly, many young drivers are unlawful and unqualified to drive safely. Therefore it is necessary to keep unqualified drivers off the road and keep the road safe for qualified drivers. <h3>Section</h3> III: A law shall be enacted that replaces certain 2015 requirements with new 2016 requirements for driving privileges, while still preserving all 2015 requirements not altered below.   The knowledge test, required for a Beginner Permit, will be replaced by eight hours of classroom drivers education which includes a test at the end of the course.   The requirement of eight hours of classroom time for a Conditional License or Special-Restricted License shall be eliminated, since such training should already have been completed for the Beginner Permit.   The requirement of a total of 6 hours will be increased to 10 hours of driving time with a certified driving instructor in order for a person to obtain a Conditional License or Special-Restricted License.   As of 2015, a person must wait two weeks if he/she fails the road skills test once or twice. This new act will require a person to wait 30 days after the first or second failed attempt on the road skills test.   As of 2015, a person must wait 60 days if he/she fails the road skills test after the first or second attempt. This new act will require a person to wait 180 days if the person fails after the first or second attempt.   As of 2015, a person can obtain full driving privileges if he/she has had a Conditional License for one year and has not had any traffic offenses. With this new act, a person must retake the road skills test after obtaining Conditional or Special-Restricted privileges regardless of whether the person has already had a Conditional or Special-Restricted License for a year. <h3>Section</h3> IV: Only the most qualified drivers will be allowed on South Carolina roads. The least qualified drivers will be kept off of the roads, which could reduce fatality on the road. <h3>Section</h3> V: When signed into law, no one will obtain a permit or license after 2015 without completing the new requirements listed above.   South Carolina YMCA Youth In Government 27th Annual Model Legislature November 18th-21st, 2015  BILL ORIGINATES  IN: Premier Senate BILL NUMBER: PS83 RECOMMENDED FOR COMMITTEE: PB AUTHORS: Anna Grace Gowens and Ellen Spiers BILL SPONSOR: SCHOOL/CLUB: Greenville High School  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED  An Act to Make CPR Training a High School Graduation Requirement   BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA <h3>Section</h3> 1:  There is no current law stating that CPR is a graduation requirement.  This bill will make it a requirement by the 2017 school year. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  When signed into law, this bill will add CPR training to the list of graduation requirements in South Carolina. <h3>Section</h3> 3: CPR- Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation- is an emergency procedure in which circulation of oxygen and blood are restored.  In a cardiac emergency, immediate CPR doubles and sometimes triples a victims chance of survival. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  The effect of this bill would be to save lives, and to prepare and educate students on medical emergencies. <h3>Section</h3> 5:  When signed into law, this bill will go into effect in the 2017 school year.

**************************************************

**************************************************
text:		<h3>Section</h3>1:  Bike lanes would drastically decrease the amounts of deaths in america. <h3>Section</h3> 2: In 2013 over 4,735 deaths were caused due to pedestrian/motor crashes and 48,000 injuries, that was around 12 deaths per day. <h3>Section</h3> 3: The cost of bicycle injury and death is around $4 billion per year. <h3>Section</h3> 4: One mile of protected bike lane is 100 times cheaper than one mile of roadway, it costs around $445,000 per mile of protected bike lane, and $571 million per mile of roadway. <h3>Section</h3> 5: By making 8,988 miles of protected bike lane per year it would be around the same price as the $4 billion sunk into bike and pedestrian/motor crash deaths and injuries per year. <h3>Section</h3> 6: There are no protected bike lanes here in South Carolina. <h3>Section</h3> 7: In the US there are about 8,656,070 miles of road, in South Carolina there is about 41,000 miles of road. <h3>Section</h3> 8: If we create 41,000 miles of protected bike lane it would cost around $18,245,000,000 with a South Carolina population of around 4,832,482, if every month the taxpayers put in an extra $10 it would take around 30 years to finish all the protected bike lanes, and make South Carolina a better place. <h3>Section</h3> 9: When signed into law, the construction of bike lanes and taxes will begin after January 1, 2016.

title:		An Act to Improve Domestic Violence Shelters
**************************************************

**************************************************
text:		<h3>Section</h3>1: If domestic violence shelters dont have programs to help victims become independent, they will be given 90 days to improve. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Funds will be allocated to shelters in order for them to create programs to benefit the health of victims. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Domestic violence shelters that dont improve within their time limit will be warned, and must improve and meet South Carolina standards for shelters.    After the warning the executive director of the domestic violence shelter will be fined $2000.00 if the improvement is not made.    If the domestic violence shelter executive director hasnt done the improvements after the fine, he/she will be terminated and replaced. <h3>Section</h3> 4: A unimproved domestic violence shelter limits the possibility of victims becoming independent. Shelters get packed with people every day so those victims who have been there for a while need to get mentally and financially independent, so they can go out in the world and be successful. <h3>Section</h3> 5: We are asking the government to send 1 million dollars to each domestic violence shelter in South Carolina that don't have all the programs to benefit the victims in the shelter. For example (Things we need in everyday life that support us in a healthy lifestyle. ) <h3>Section</h3> 6:The funding for the money to help the domestic violence shelters will come from the cigarettes and beer beverages taxes, also programs that support domestic violence to stop will help also. <h3>Section</h3> 7: When signed into law, the first shelter inspections will begin after January 1, 2016.

title:		Allowing Cellular Devices  An Act to Provide Better Cell Service in Schools
**************************************************

**************************************************
text:		<h3>Section</h3>1:  Currently, the majority of schools in South Carolina do not allow students to use cellular devices in class. We will be enacting a law to permit the use of mobile devices in schools during certain time periods. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  We will be lifting the ban of phones in school and eliminate the blockage of service during independent and group work to help students. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  Though some may argue this will decrease student interaction and engagement in class, it will actually increase student involvement and push them to work more. It will reduce the amount of students being written up and kicked out of class for using their mobile devices, which provides them more time in class. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  Lifting the ban and allowing service will:    Assist students with contacting parents in case of an emergency and access information on their devices.   Allow students and faculty to use learning tools that involve mobile devices.   Reduce the amount of mobile devices being taken and students receiving referrals for using them.   Provide students with a set time in each class period (independent work, group work, and the any time not used for assessments or instruction) to use their phones and allow them immunity from referrals relating to device usage during that time. <h3>Section</h3> 5: When signed into law, the bill will begin enforcement the 2016-2017 school year.
