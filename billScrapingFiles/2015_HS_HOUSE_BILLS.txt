An Act to Make Photo Identification of Voters Mandatory

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, voters in South Carolina are only requested to present an ID or a voter registration card. A photo ID is not required. This bill would require all persons voting to present a valid photo ID in order for their ballot to be counted. 

Section 2: In order to assure that everyone is capable of obtaining such an ID, those with any disability hindering them from receiving a driver’s license or other valid form of photo identification will be issued a suitable photo ID on their eighteenth birthday at no cost. 

Section 3: By requiring residents to present a photo ID in order to be eligible to vote, credibility threats such as voter fraud are theoretically eliminated.

Section 4: When signed into law, these IDs will become mandatory on January 1st, 2016.

An Act to Implement a Flat State Income Tax

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: A flat tax of 4% will be placed on all South Carolina income tax brackets.

Section 2: The first  $11,520 dollars of income are tax free.

Section 3: The progressive income tax in place now will be completely repealed, replacing the tax code with the more simplified and loophole free flat tax.

Section 4: A flat tax taxes all income levels evenly. The brackets who earned between $2,880 and $11,520 before saw a tax rate ranging from 3 to 5%. These earners will now pay no state income tax. All tax brackets above this income level saw 6 to 7%, these earner will now all have the same flat income tax of 4%.

Section 5: No income tax on the lower tax brackets will be left with more expendable income, helping to get back on their feet. The higher earners will now be able to put more money back into the economy due to a lower, and even rate. The higher earners will be able to invest more and make more money, balancing out the revenue lost from the tax cut.

Section 6: This bill will go into effect January 1st 2016, at the start of the first fiscal quarter.

An Act to Give a Tax Reduction to Restaurants with No-Hands-Required Restrooms

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In order to provide an incentive to restaurants to take measures to protect employees’ and customers’ health, any restaurant with a no-hands-required bathroom will receive a 1% tax reduction.

Section 2: The definition of a no-hands-required restroom, defined by this bill, is:
	•	A restroom door that needs to be pushed so that an individual can leave.

An Act to mandate that 10 days before any election there will be a “no-excuse” early ballot and also a “no-excuse” postal ballot

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current law in South Carolina requires an excuse for early voting, and postal voting. Only one voting station is available for early voting.
Section 2: This law would allow anyone to participate in early voting, or postal voting without an excuse. All normal voting stations will open on this early voting day, which would be on a Saturday.
Section 3: This would be useful for those working during the regular Tuesday election day and would hopefully reduce wait time for voting. 
Section 4: This law would hopefully encourage more people to vote on Election Day.
	•	In 2012 only 54.9% of registered voters voted. 
	•	The online process for filing an excuse is confusing and time consuming, especially for the elderly.
	•	The wait on these early election days to vote can be several hours long since there is only one station with only a few machines. 
Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will take place for elections in 2016.

An Act to allow foster children to receive their driver’s license

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state law that prohibits foster parents from signing off on a foster child’s Driver’s license. This prohibits the child from getting a driver’s license. 

Section 2: This law would entail a parent signing a document that states they assume legal and financial responsibility for the foster child’s driving. Thus, the foster child would be able to get their license and be able to drive.

Section 3: Because this bill would cause a parent to assume responsibility for a child that may only be with them temporarily, the parent would be able to remove their signature. This would cause the child to lose their license until they get a new foster parent to sign the document, as described in section 2, or until they turned 18.

Section 4: This bill would allow:
	•	The child would be able to drive 
	•	The foster parent to assist their foster child by signing off on their license documents.

Section 5: When signed into law, the bill would take effect immediately.

An Act to reduce smoking in public places

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In most public areas people are not penalized for smoking.  Secondhand smoke is a danger to anyone exposed, particularly children.  Our bill will penalize and restrict public smoking promoting public safety and health.  While smoking is currently restricted in government workplaces, schools, and child care facilities, smoking is not prohibited in general public areas.

Section 2: No amount of secondhand smoke is safe.  Secondhand smoke has been shown in studies by the CDC to be highly detrimental to health and cause coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer.  The effect on children is even more detrimental causing asthma, respiratory infections, ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome.  A CDC study in 2012 shows that 25% of Americans were exposed to secondhand smoke.  This will most impact families below the poverty line, who are unable to afford expensive medical care for smoking related health concerns, which will then become the burden of the state.
-Establishments would be able to apply for a license to allow patrons to smoke within their premises.  If approved, businesses must renew licenses biannually to maintain this permit, without exception.

Section 3: No funding will be required for the enforcement of this bill.  It shall be enforced by Local law enforcement personnel, who already patrol public areas.  

Section 4: Local law enforcement will enforce this law through the issuing of tickets, as they would with any other punishable offence.  

Section 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1st, 2016.Businesses will be allowed to apply for permits one month prior to the law going into effect.

An Act to Require CPR Certification for Teachers
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: CPR Certification for South Carolina’s public school teachers will make the state’s school setting safer. This proposed law would require 75% of teachers in each public school to become CPR Certified. CPR training teaches an individual how to respond to cardiac and breathing emergencies. Teachers would be more prepared to identify health issues students could face and act quickly to resolve them. The required course would also include basic first aid training as well, teaching them how to control bleeding cuts or scrapes and how to identify heart attack or choking symptoms. 

Section 2: The schools will decide which teachers must become certified. The additional certified teachers will allow for a better outcome when a student faces a health emergency, and injured children will receive a faster response. Other states, like Virginia, for example, currently require all teachers to receive CPR Certification, and the list is growing. Bills have been introduced in both New York and Massachusetts. 

Section 3: This will be funded through an additional penny tax on cigarettes throughout South Carolina. The price of the course ranges from $40 to $60, so at most $2.7 million is needed to certify the 45,000 public school teachers. The penny tax would bring in about $3 million since about 300 million packs of cigarettes are sold a year in the state, so it would cover the expense.

Section 4: It is the local school boards’ responsibility to oversee this requirement. The school must have 75% or more of the teachers certified by the end of the year the bill goes into effect.  If a school does not meet this deadline, the school board will issue a warning. If the school continues to violate the law, the school board will no longer renew the contracts of the administration at the school.

Section 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Allow the Open Carry of Handguns

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  The definition of a handgun is a firearm designed to be held and fired with one hand.  Currently, South Carolina has the policy that prohibits the Open Carry of Handguns.  The law that we propose will allow the Open Carry of Handguns in South Carolina.

Section 2:  Our bill proposes to make South Carolina an open carry state. Residents would be required to obtain a license to carry handguns in a holster, in public, which would include a background check.  There will be areas that will not allow firearms to be openly carried such as hospitals, schools, and religious places of worship.  Since 2010, there have been 20,000 robberies, and a gun related murder occurs approximately every 14 hours in South Carolina. Currently, of the 7 states that prohibit open carry policies, 5 are in the top twenty states for gun related violence, two being in the top 5. Open Carry laws deter crime, as criminals are less likely to attack or rob an armed individual.  It has been reported that 92% of criminal attacks are deterred when a gun is merely shown.  Also, if residents are familiarized with guns, they are more likely to be used in a safe, controlled manner.

Section 3:  This law will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and paid for by a 5% tax on gun sales, which would pay for the licensing and background checks for those who apply. The penalty for those openly carrying a handgun without a license, or carrying any other type of firearm with a license (hunting is not included), will be ticketed, can have the firearm confiscated, and possibly arrested, which will be determined by the circumstances.

Section 4:  After being signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1, 2015

An Act to End Rape Kit Backlog

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Today, when a rape crime is committed and is reported by the victim, a sexual assault evidence kit is put together, containing DNA swabs, photographs, and other evidence that could possibly determine potential suspects. These kits, typically called rape kits, are often stored away in law enforcement facilities and can only be tested if requested by a detective or prosecutor. This results in numerous kits remaining untested and accumulating in what is known as rape kit backlog, leaving many rape victims unaware of their attacker and awaiting justice for long periods of time due to a lack of legislature mandating the testing of their kit. 

Section 2: There is currently no law in South Carolina requiring the testing of rape kits or dealing with backlog. This a pressing issue because it just leaves victims feeling helpless when law enforcement could be doing more to help them. We propose a law that requires all rape kits to be tested within 30 days of their collection. This would insure that any DNA evidence collected will be run through the criminal database to check to see if any existing information in the database matches that of the evidence collected in the rape kit.  

Section 3: This bill will be funded by a statewide public sales tax increase of 0.5%. This tax increase would be allocated towards providing more jobs and resources to test the kits.

Section 4: This bill will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. 

Section 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Protect Religious Institutions

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  This act will make it illegal for a religious institution to lose their tax exempt status (501c3) solely due to the fact that they do not preform marriages for homosexual couples. This is not an act to ban gay marriage, it is an act however to protect the rights of religious institutions. Those who have religious beliefs that marriage should be between one man and one woman (Judeo-Christian) or a man and multiple women (Islam) are protected under the 1st amendment from government hindrances on their ability to practice their religion freely. These religions see homosexuality as a sin and should not be faced with the choice of having to violate their moral code to avoid losing their constitutional rights.

Section 2:  It is a fear of many religious leaders that because of their desire to freely practice religion (which is their right) they will lose their 501c3 status, or even be charged with a hate crime. This act prevents the government or any individual from impeding the free exercise of religion; a basic first amendment right. This act does not violate the 14th amendment because it does NOT condone the denial of public service to anyone for any reason. Our act would allow a religious institution to refuse to marry a homosexual couple solely because the moral code of said religion conflicts to homosexuality. Just as homosexuals want their rights protected and upheld, mosques, temples, and churches all deserve the same rights under the constitution.

Section 3: This bill requires no funding.

Section 4: This bill will be enforced by state courts.

Section 5:  This bill will go into effect on January 01, 2016 with the signature of the youth governor.

An Act to Provide Training to Resource Teachers for Dyslexic Children

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Dyslexia is a general term for disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols, but that do not affect general intelligence. Students with this disability have a harder time processing material during class, which affects their GPA and future. 

Section 2: Currently in South Carolina, 1 in every 5 students has the disability of Dyslexia (There is no law stating that children with this disability are to be given any special treatment.  Our bill is going to provide money to put towards the training of resource teachers for the Ortan Gillingham curriculum. The resource teachers will be trained in the Ortan Gillingham curriculum in order to optimize the success of dyslexic students.  All resource teachers must be trained by the beginning of the 2017/2018 school year.

Section 3:  This bill will be funded through revenue generated by the SC State Education Lottery.  The SC State Board of Education will then require all public school districts to have all resource teachers trained in the Ortan Gillingham curriculum.  This training will be offered regionally throughout the state, free of charge to resource teachers.  

Section 4:  The justifications for this law are as follows:
	•	20-25% of all adults can only read at the lowest level.  This reading level for        adults is because of the lack of education and help they needed in school because of their disability. If this law had been in effect in the past, then we would most likely see more adults reading at a high level.
	•	According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 38% of all fourth grade students are “below basic” reading skills. They are at or below the 40th percentile for their age group.  With our curriculum this reading level will be much higher.
	•	62% of Dyslexic children dropped out of high school in 2007.  When our bill goes into effect, this percentage will drop dramatically.

Section 5:   
	•	A benefit of this bill would be the progression dyslexia students would make in their education. 
	•	This bill will benefit the students with Dyslexia and help reduce the education barriers they have to overcome due to their disability.

Patriot Pet Act

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: A Military Working Dog or an MWD is an asset to our military that many militaries do not have. MWD’s provide the ability of sniffing for bombs, sensing attacks, and most importantly the companionship of soldiers while they are away. These MWD’s, on average save about 200 lives and we do not save them as they save us. As we go off to war with these animals bred in the USA we do not bring them home. We do not think about the dogs rights and are not willing to spend money on these dogs that protect us in the line of fire. These dogs are sold off, euthanized or simply abandoned. These dogs are sometimes taken in by the people of these countries and eaten. These American heroes need and deserve more from our people.    	

Section 2: We propose to bring these dogs, that we call family, home. These dogs are met and treasured by our military and provide warmth to the ones willing to protect our freedom and our government does not have the resources to bring home these heroes.	 

Section 3: An annual budget of $400,000 USD will be allotted towards the evaluation and transportation of these MWD’s.  This money will come from the $7.4 billion USD allotted in South Carolina towards the Department of Defense. These dogs will be up for adoption for the 31 percent of veterans living in South Carolina that suffer through post-traumatic stress disorder. The veterans must be screened and deemed responsible before obtaining the MWD. The dogs will be sold for $40 USD to qualified veterans. This revenue will be given to the SC Division of Veterans’ Affairs. 

Section 4: The justifications for this bill are as follows:
	•	31 percent of veterans living in South Carolina have PTSD.
	•	Studies show that having a dog in the house reduces stress and reduces the symptoms of PTSD.
	•	Dogs provide emotional support to veterans.
	•	Studies show that the veteran and the MWD bond better than a dog that has never experienced the struggle of war.
C. Our American heroes are being eaten for food, rather than being treasured as man’s best friend. These despicable humans are taking away the rights of beings that give all they have for the place that they call home.

Section 5: The benefits for this bill are as follows:
	•	Over the next 5 years, over 1000 dogs will be left in the line of fire with nowhere to turn. With this bill signed into law this drastic amount of MWD’s will be saved from certain death.
	•	More than 8,030 veterans kill themselves each year in the USA.
	•	With MWD’s this number will drop exponentially. 
	•	South Carolina has one of the highest number of veterans proportionally with 408,747 veterans.

Section 6: This bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Decrease Food Stamp Fraud in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In 2012, researchers found that $80 billion were distributed through food stamps as one in seven Americans received government funding in the form of EBT cards. In 2009 alone, $2.2 billion was wasted in fraudulent activity of people taking advantage of the system and the number has only increased since then.

Section 2:	 The current application process of food stamps/EBT cards that allows representatives of those applying to complete the application process would be changed to require those applying for benefits to come for an in-person interview with a social services government-certified employee, enabling identity verification.

Section 3:	 The government would have to spend money creating designated offices as well as employing social workers. However, the government will save much more money than they spend improving this program, as fraudulent activity will greatly decrease.

Section 4:	 The benefits of this act include:
	•	Saving money that would otherwise be wasted due to food stamp fraud.
	•	There would be an increase in jobs, as more social workers are needed to keep the system organized and conduct interviews with applicants, thereby, stimulating the economy. 

Section 5: When signed into law, it will be enacted on January 1, 2016.

Section 1: Police officers’ average salary in the state of South Carolina is approximately $28,000 per year. With such a low income level, most struggle to live comfortably with an average-sized family of 4 or 5. Police officers have one of the most heroic and dangerous jobs. They risk their lives every day for the people of this state and they deserve to get paid a decent wage.

Section 2:	 This bill will get its money from taxes. There are 272 police agencies employing around 11,674 police officers in South Carolina. The tax increase would be about 1.2%. The tax would be divided up equally between all employed police officers. This is a small price to pay for the big price those men and women give every day.  

Section 3:	 So many qualified people go on to other lines of service or duty because of greater pay. For example, the average annual income for a soldier in the US Army would be $38,000-$40,000. People would stay home and protect their fellow citizens if they had the opportunity to make a comparative salary. If the salaries were increased, our state would be able to put the most qualified officers out into the field, which would make our state safer.  

Section 4:	 When signed into law, this bill will be enforced beginning on January 1, 2016.

An Act Relating To Banning the Use of All Handheld Electronic Devices while Operating a Motor Vehicle

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: A person in the state of South Carolina may not use any handheld electronic device while operating a motor vehicle. The definition of “handheld electronic device” is any portable electronic device that requires the use of the driver’s hands and is not part of the operating equipment of a motor vehicle, including (but not limited to) an electronic game, device for sending or receiving e-mail, text-messaging device, cellular telephone, and computer. 

Section 2:	 The use of hands-free electronic devices will be acceptable. The definition of “hands-free electronic device” is any electronic device that does not require the use of the driver’s hands. This may be part of the operating equipment of a motor vehicle. GPS, radio, and other hands-free electronics may be operated.

Section 3:	 A person who violates this section commits a traffic infraction for which a fine of not less than $150 may be adjudged.  

Section 4:	 To limit distracted driving, licensed drivers under eighteen are not allowed to use a cellular telephone while driving. At any given moment during daylight hours across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or are manipulating electronic devices while driving, a number that has held steady since 2010. Engaging in visual-manual subtasks (such as reaching for a phone, dialing, and texting) associated with the use of hand-held phones and other portable devices increased the risk of getting into an accident by three times. A study from the University of Utah indicates that when both younger and older drivers used cell-phones, their reactions were 18% slower, and there was a two-fold increase in the number of rear-end collisions. For drivers 15-19 years old involved in fatal crashes, 21% of the distracted drivers were distracted by the use of cellular telephones. 

Section 5: The use of handheld electronic devices shall be banned in the state of South Carolina in order to prevent distracted driving. Hands-free electronic devices, such as in-vehicle systems, will still be acceptable to use. 

Section 6:  When signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act for Off-Campus Lunch Reserved for Licensed Students

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Current law states that students are required to stay on campus for their lunch periods. Students that have their driver’s licenses should be given the privilege to go off-campus during their lunch schedule.

Section 2:	 Students with driver’s licenses will be allowed to leave school for their lunch periods. Lunch is meant to be a break period, to rest your brain for the rest of the school day. Therefore, leaving schools grounds for lunch should be a part of the break period. 

Section 3:	 Students must have a method of transportation to participate in the off-campus lunch law. Walking off-campus is prohibited. If students do not have a vehicle, then they must stay at school for their lunch break. This law is only applicable to licensed drivers. Students must also have a waiver signed by their parent or legal guarding, releasing the school from any liability in the case of an accident. 

Section 4:	 Advantages of this act include:

	•	This act will decrease the chaos of the lunch room crowding
	•	This act is cost effective, because schools do not have to provide as many meals for lunch
	•	This bill is a privilege that students must maintain with good behavior.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will take action in the school year of 2016-2017.Clear formatting and concise descriptions make for better debate and clearer                understanding!

An Act to Require the Learning of a Language in Middle and Elementary Schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Each elementary and middle school should be required to have specific language classes to begin learning a second language whether it be English, French, or Spanish.

Section 2:	 To keep these programs efficient, there must be at least three teachers at each school that speak a second language. Students will be required to take the language class of their choice at specific times twice a week. 

Section 3:	 This bill allows non-English speaking students to be at the same level as others and take English as their second language through a specific class. Native-English speaking students will be expected to take French or Spanish. That way, all students are learning a new language throughout their elementary and middle school years.

Section 4:	 After taking these language courses as a young student, students are more advanced in the language and can understand it more fluently when high school comes. This is important because in high school a student is only required to take two years of language to graduate. In two years a student will not be able to fully understand and reciprocate the language. Whereas if the student took the course throughout their entire education, he would be able to speak the language fluently or at least be able to comprehend the language better.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will take effect on August 1, 2016.

An Act to limit the Class Sizes in K3-3rd Grades

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The average class size in K3-3rd grade is 25-26 students. The average size in K3 is 9-10 students. The average class size in K-3rd grade would be reduced to 19-20 students. In K3, class size would be reduced to 7-8 students. 

Section 2:	 Students who come from groups that are traditionally disadvantaged in education will benefit from this bill the most. Students are less likely to be retained, more likely to stay in school and earn better grades. Reducing the class sizes in the early grades reduces the amount of distractions in the room and gives the teacher more time to devote to each child. In early grades, students are just beginning to learn the rules of the classroom. If they have more opportunity to interact with their teacher, they are more apt to feel that they can cope with these changes. Reducing class size is a great way for states and public schools to show that they are improving the quality of education because smaller classes allow teachers to spend more time on instruction and less on classroom management. 

Section 3:	 Classes with fewer students will have more one-on-one time with their teacher. This will help all students in K3 to 3rd grade because they will have more time with the teacher than if the teacher had to help 5 more students to understand something. Many studies have shown an increase in student achievement and fewer discipline problems as a result of class size reductions. 

Section 4:	 Education researchers suspect that class size reduction in early grades increases student achievement because there is a greater opportunity for individual interaction between student and teacher in a smaller class. This will benefit teachers also, because they feel less overwhelmed by having a bigger class. As a result, they are more likely to provide a supportive environment. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the first class size reduction will go into effect the upcoming school year in 2016-2017.

An Act to Amend Existing Child Labor Laws

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, South Carolina child labor regulations prohibit minors under the age of 16 from preparing food, operating lawn mowers and/or golf carts, and performing tasks requiring the use of a ladder. 

Section 2: This bill proposes a removal of the aforementioned restrictions, as they are generally unreasonable when considering the heightened sense of responsibility in teens who work. 

Section 3: In order to obtain employment, an interviewer must be able to clearly observe and distinguish traits of responsibility in potential job-holders. In light of their apparent responsibility, minors under the age of 16 should not have to be restricted by the laws currently upheld by the state of South Carolina, and should be trusted enough by their employers to be allowed to work with equipment deemed hazardous by the government. 

Section 4: Should this bill be passed, they will contribute to a diversified work experience, reduce excessive strain on older workers, and promote efficient and appropriate usage of a company’s available staff and resources. 

Section 5: If passed, this change will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Secure Accessibility on School Wireless Internet

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: School wireless internet systems in many schools allows access to a very limited number of websites, including websites that are meant for educational purposes.

Section 2:	 This causes issues with data usage and limited access to certain websites, and therefore causes restrictions on the utilization of technology in school.

Section 3:	 Because schools often require the use of technology, school wireless internet should not have limits. This would not change the cell phone policies in schools, so phone usage should not become a bigger problem because of this bill.

Section 4:	 Eliminating restrictions on school wireless internet systems would be beneficial because: 

	•	 It will increase student participation
	•	 It will encourage a better work ethic
	•	 Students who do not have the ability to use cellular data will be able to access teacher-approved websites in class.

Section 2: People age 18 or older will legally be able to purchase and consume alcohol.

Section 3: 18-20 year olds who are arrested for driving under the influence, distributing alcohol to minors, or any other alcohol related crime, will suffer the consequences of breaking the law and immediate suspension from buying or consuming alcohol until the age of 21.

Section 4: 18-20 year olds that are suspended will be put into a database of others suspended individuals and be forced to get a new license with the suspension posted on it. Refusal to get a new license within a week of the suspension will result in a a fine of $1,000 for each following week until one is received.

Section 5: When signed into law the lowering of the drinking age will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Install a 911 Text Messaging Service

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, emergency services may only be reached by a phone call to notify dispatchers of an emergency. This service will now be able to be reached via text messages to 911. 

Section 2:	 The texting service provided will charge a small, additional fee of $0.15 to the current 911 fee. The fee will be applied so long as the 911 service is provided. 

Section 3:	 This additional service will provide a very safe and discreet way to contact 911 in case of an emergency where the victim is forced to remain quiet and is prevented from communicating with anyone outside of the current setting he/she is in. 911 would be notified immediately, and the victim would not be put in danger of being heard. Anyone that would text 911 for an emergency that is not legitimate would be forced by law to face identical consequences to those of someone who prank-calls 911. This includes a fine of no more than $200.00 or imprisonment of six months at the most. However, some cases result in both consequences. 

Section 4:	 This bill would benefit people by:

	•	 Increasing the chances of criminals being caught in the act immediately
	•	 Saving lives of people in need and creating a safer way for victims to get help
	•	 Delivering fines enforced upon improper usage of 911 towards local hospitals for helping those who cannot afford treatment.

Section 5: When signed into law, this service will be available immediately.

An Act to Allow Exemptions on Final Exams

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In many South Carolina districts, school policy mandates that all high school students must take a final exam at the end of the school year. This bill will create a law allowing high school students to be exempted from final exams. 

Section 2:	 The state law would be changed so that a student with an “A” average, 93%-100%, for the entire school year in an Honors of College Prep (CP) course may be exempted from the course final exam.

Section 3:	 By giving students a reward for getting an “A” in their Honors or CP courses it would benefit many students because it will make them strive to work harder throughout the year so they can receive an “A” for their final grade, which will allow them to be exempted from final exam.

Section 4:	 This will also help students who struggle with taking big exams due to anxiety or not being able to focus for long periods of time by giving them the opportunity to not have to take their final exams. This bill will would:

	•	Allow students to exempt their final exams in Honors and CP courses.
	•	It would only apply to students with an “A” average for the year.
	•	It would make students more motivated to get an “A” average for the year.
	•	It would prevent students from damaging a grade in a course they have already proven they have knowledge of.

Section 1: Public schools in the state of South Carolina will be required to have a limit of 25 students per class in academic classes. In elective classes the limit can be larger depending on circumstances that will be decided by the district office. 

Section 2:	 All academic classes shall have a limit of 25 students per classroom. This will provide a more stable learning environment and students will be able to have more one-on-one guidance with the teacher.

Section 3:	 There would be no funding necessary for this law. Some schools may have to hire more teachers for their schools if needed. This will create more job openings for teachers and will also benefit the students. Every public school will be required to follow this law once enacted. Private schools will get the choice of following the law or to continue their ways. 

Section 4:	 Benefits to limiting class size:

An Act to Lessen the Number of Students a Teacher is Issued in School

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In school (grades K5 through 12th grade) the number of students a teacher is issued would be reduced to a 20 student per teacher limit. The average class size is currently 25 students per teacher. The current average causes certain students not to reach their full potential and develop a personal relationship with their teacher.

Section 2:	 To help increase the standards of education in students, student-to-teacher ratio will be reduced. This will allow for more interaction in the classroom between students and teacher and fewer distractions in a more intimate setting. As a result, students will have a clearer and increased understanding of what is being taught.

Section 3:	 To gain the necessary funding, there will be a redistribution of state lottery funds from the college scholarship program. $2.7 billion has been spent on college scholarships whereas only $104 million is spent on programs in grades K-12. A redistribution of funds to K-12 programs appeals to a larger percent of the population. 30% of the population receives post-secondary education, and 83% of the population receives primary or secondary education. In addition, nearly 40% of inmates in state prison have not received a secondary education, indicating another reason to increase funding and focus on programs in grades K-12.

Section 4:	 The Education Accountability Act Resource programs would enforce the Education Oversight Committee and the State Board of Education to handle redistributing the lottery funds to pay for more teachers, classrooms, and other supplies.

Section 1:  Currently South Carolina does not have a state law requiring employers to offer paid parental leave. Businesses determine whether to provide parental leave to employees- paid or unpaid. Bigger businesses usually provide such royalties, however smaller businesses do not guarantee either of these leaves. 

Section 2: This bill will require all businesses to provide paternal or maternal paid leave to their employees. 

Section 3: With this bill in effect, the standard minimum paid leave will be six weeks for women and four weeks for men. The business may choose a standard maximum paid leave as well as allowing extended unpaid leave. 

Section 4: Benefits include:
	•	Families and businesses will be supported.
	•	Women given paid maternal leave are more likely to return to the business rather than those who are not given the opportunity.
	•	This will allow stable income to families.

An Act to Prevent Medicaid and Welfare Abuse

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
				
Section 1: Under current South Carolina law, Medicaid and Welfare enrollees can receive benefits from these programs without drug testing of any kind.  These benefits include health care, food stamps, etc.  This allows for the enrollees to be spending a portion of their income on illegal or addictive substances while the government pays for the enrollees’ essentials of modern life (phone, electric, water bills).  

Section 2: Upon the application of this act, Medicaid and Welfare enrollees will undergo random drug testing to ensure valuable taxpayer money is not being wasted on illegal substances.  These drug tests can occur during any hospital visits an enrollee might make, or during regularly scheduled visits to a general practitioner. These tests can also occur during the SNAP and Welfare application process.  Once enrolled, enrollees must submit to at least two drug tests per year.  

Section 3: According to a study conducted by UCLA at Berkeley, the US spends 152.8 billion dollars on welfare programs.  To ensure valuable taxpayer money is not wasted, abusers will be denied welfare and medicaid for a period of time, starting at one month and increasing each time they abuse after the original incident.  A person testing positive can still receive benefits if they comply with a treatment plan.  To promote sobriety, a reward, decided upon by the organization under which the enrollee falls, will be given yearly to those who demonstrate that they can responsibly use Welfare and Medicaid.   
			
Section 4: Any and all drug testing created under this act will be funded from two sources: 
	•	1% increase in sales tax on: a) Alcohol and b) Tobacco products.
	•	A small portion of the money already allocated to Medicaid in SC (less than .01% of the program’s funding).

Any and all taxpayer money saved by this act will be distributed among three things:
	•	The development and repair of South Carolina roads and highways
	•	Developing equitable solutions to renewable energy initiatives in South Carolina
	•	Rewards given to responsible welfare recipients. 

Section 5: When signed into law, drug testing during hospital and general practitioner visits will begin on January 1st, 2016.  SNAP and Welfare application drug testing will follow and begin on March 1st, 2016.

An Act to Create a State Flat Tax

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  We would demolish the social status barrier that taxing holds. Therefore eliminate the “1%” and regroup all economic social classes including; the homeless, lower class, lower-middle class, upper-middle class, lower-upper class, upper-upper class and anything in between. Thus one step closer to lowering the $40,000,000,000 debt that we are in. 

Section 2:  The state would exempt anyone who makes $20,000 or less. This is to excuse the homeless. But in hopes to motivate and lower the homeless population by providing an economic cushion. The minimum amount of money a minimum working person can earn is $1,827 (252 working days). 

Section 3: Seven states have already enacted this Law and the general state debt has decreased in at least 42%. These states include, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah. 

Section 4: The current percentage of unemployed, in poverty, or homeless rate in South Carolina is around 29% meaning that there are about 1,450,000 people. If the statistics are reliable of the other 7 states. The rate of those in need would be lowered to only 6.8%.

Section 5:  We would set the rate at 4.2%. 

Section 6: This bill will be enacted January 2, 2016.

A Bill to Eliminate the Insanity Defense

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
SECTION 1: The current law states that if a criminal is found guilty, or not guilty, by mental insanity they are required to undergo mental rehabilitation. This rehabilitation is required until the criminal is found mentally stable by a psychiatric test. The criminal is then allowed to leave the psychiatric institution once found sane. 

SECTION 2: This act hereby eliminates insanity as a defense. 

SECTION 3: Eliminating the insanity defense would allow for a guilty defendant, to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for the crime(s) they commit. If sentenced to time in prison, psychiatric aid will still be given to the mentally unstable. 

SECTION 4: Eliminating the insanity defense would make criminals, mentally stable or unstable, eligible for whatever punishment is decided by the judge or jury. 

SECTION 5: When signed into law, this bill will go into effect January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

	Driver’s Test Again…?

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: 	In the state of South Carolina you are required to renew you Driver’s License, but NOT retake your Driver’s Test. I believe that this practice is outdated and potentially dangerous to other drivers on the road. I propose that every five years, South Carolina Citizens should retake their Driver’s Test to insure that they are following all state laws and regulations and are practicing safe driving daily.

Section 2: 	Taking the test every five years would give more money to the state because in order to retake the test you would be charged a testing fee of $12.50. If the state government put a tax on the dmv for the quinquennial testing (government can only tax on the retesting fee), it would give them a little chunk of money and we are always looking for that. The State government could implement a .05% tax rate towards the dmv’s $12.50 they make per citizen that has to retest. That would give our government 0.625 cents per person. South Carolina (in 2014) had the population of 4.832 million people and it is still constantly rising. That tax towards the amount of people would give our State Government 3,020,000 million dollars every five years!  

Section 3: 	South Carolina is rated second to worst by Car Insurance Comparison and that is a problem I think we need to fix. South Carolina is ranked number eight in the nation for fatalities in wrecks that involve alcohol. 40% of the 767 crash fatalities last year involved an impaired driver in one of the cars. We are ranked number five in the nation in careless driving.  We are ranked number fifteen in the nation for speeding contributing to fatalities in car wrecks. 40% of people that are involved in fatal car wrecks weren’t wearing seatbelts. In order to cause less laws and regulations from being broken and to stop careless driving from occurring we need to put retesting into effect! Making the retesting a new law, would benefit us all because it would give South Carolina Citizens the knowledge again and help them to remember that laws, regulations, the traffic signs, and all of the things not to do while driving. It would help us to practice safer driving and for us to go up in the rankings as well. It would defiantly cause the fatalities to occur less as well. The retesting would refurbish our brains with the knowledge we need to know to practice safer driving and if you fail the test it looks like you won’t be driving till you pass! This would keep safer drivers on the road and not so safe drivers off the road. All of this retesting would cause the statistics I mentioned in the beginning of this section to change. Plus, it would give a tax to our state government, which would be great because hey, who doesn’t like money? This would be a really good tradeoff for our government and cause a safer economy for our citizens.

Section 4: It would be funded by the citizens of South Carolina because they would have to pay to retake the test and then government would receive a tax from the dmv’s allowing them to make money off of it. The $12.50 paid from a single citizen to the dmv, would be taxed by our government, and that would give them .0625 per person since they would be taxing 0.05%. Safer driving, less fatal wrecks, and money paid to the dmv’s and taxed by the state government, would make a safer and more stable economy. This would be a win win for the state of South Carolina.

Section 5: 	If/when signed into law, the retesting would begin on January 1st, 2016, and would be for anyone who needs to renew their Driver’s License and then they would start the cycle of the quinquennial process of retesting to improve safer roads. It would continue on for every one throughout the year and whoever needs to renew then needs to retake. Then five years later the retesting would take place again. (license needs to be renewed yearly though)

An act to re-allocate funds for public schools in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in South Carolina, the base student cost for public schools is $2770. In poorer districts, only $2100 is able to be raised for each student. This is due to Act 388, which changed public schools from being funded by property taxes to a 1% sales tax. 

Section 2: This bill will re-determine how funds for public schools are raised and distributed. A population based system taking funds from property taxes will be instituted. 

Section 3: In 2004, the base student cost (BSC) per year was $3170, and was able to be paid in full. Since then it has decreased by about $400. Changing back to a property tax as the method of raising funds for public schools will allow for better education for each student. Additionally, the money given from the state to these school districts will be distributed based on population, so that each student's BSC can be met, unlike the current situation. 

Section 4: Property taxes would be allocated by a special committee in the state government, and any schools that provide false numbers of students for extra funding would lose all state funds, which make up approximately 50% of their funding. 

Section 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Incentivize the Use of Energy Efficient Vehicles in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: South Carolina citizens need to decrease their reliance on gasoline. There are two major reasons for urgency of this bill. Firstly, the use of gasoline increases the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A leading example of the effects of greenhouse gases is global warming. Humans possess a big role in the production of the excessive amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. The problem does not really lie in the fact that cars produce carbon dioxide because they are recycling carbon dioxide that is already in the air, the problem lies in the fact that we keep taking fossil fuels which releases old carbon dioxide, that is not supposed to be in current circulation in the air. An increase of carbon dioxide in addition with the other greenhouse gases, will over time increase the atmospheric temperature, melt polar ice caps, and eventually deplete fresh water resources and destroy environments resulting in the extinction of many species. Another reason, and a very important one, that ties to our role as a part of a powerful nation in the world, is the fact that we rely too much fossil fuels; which creates our gasoline and many other sources of energy. It is inevitable that we will run out of fossil fuels, must likely in the near future. The running out of fossil fuels, with no other reliable resource in energy, will result in a dramatic rise in prices, and possible a war over fossil fuels.

Section 2: It is important that South Carolina starts to become more self-sufficient in regards to energy; and it needs to be done one step at a time. It is understood that South Carolina cannot stop its reliance on fossil fuels all at once. So, we propose that citizens of South Carolina use Flex Fuel and electric vehicles. Once South Carolina becomes independent from the use of gasoline, we can help the nation to become self-sufficient too. And, once we run out of fossil fuels, our nation, America, will be able to help other nations around the world rely on other sources for energy, such as wind turbines and geothermal energy.

Section 3:  Flex Fuel cars have been around since the 1990s. These vehicles have the ability to use both gasoline and ethanol-gasoline blends up to 85%. It would be preferable to use the Flex Fuel cars with the ethanol-gasoline blend to help lesser our reliance on gasoline and therefore our reliance on fossil fuels. The use of electric cars would move us away from fossil fuels too and be beneficial for the environment, plus over the years, electric cars have become more affordable. Flex Fuel cars and electric cars are available under many popular name brands which include Ford, GMC, and Mercedes. The vehicle types range from trucks and SUVs to motorcycles and mopeds. We would encourage the use of these vehicles by using tax dollars to create charging stations for electric cars and providing tax breaks and subsidies for companies that produce Flex Fuel cars and electric cars to encourage them to build businesses here and therefore bettering our economy. We would remove property tax from the purchase of Flex Fuel and electric cars. There are also tax credits that are currently offered to people who own certain electric cars approved by the government. We are encouraging people to start buying energy efficient vehicle and hopefully in a few generations, everyone will own an energy efficient vehicle.

Section 4:  To be clear, the money is coming from tax dollars to construct electric car charging stations. The tax dollars will come from a penny tax on gasoline. We also plan to remove property tax from electric and Flex Fuel vehicles. 

Section 5:  When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.

An Act to Expand Maternity Leave Laws to Parental Leave Laws

Section 1: The current law in South Carolina does not cover maternity or any form of parental leave outside of what is federally required by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

Section 2: This bill allows for South Carolina to introduce not only maternity leave laws, but also parental leave laws for up to 16 weeks of allotted time for pregnant women and newborn or adopted children in public businesses with at least 10 employees and private employers with 40 or more employees. 

Section 3: Funding would come from the state government and a minimal percentage of taxes. This bill’s purpose is to allow parents enough time to care for their newborns before returning to work equally between fathers and mothers. By creating this bill into a law, families won’t suffer from poverty statistically caused by lack of available childcare for young infants. 

Section 4: Any businesses (public or private) that do not comply with the bill will be penalized according to the state law of South Carolina.

It is not fair for those who are not currently incarcerated to have to pay for those who are and get to live relatively comfortably without doing any work.

Section 3:	 The new solar panelling and stationary generator bikes will be installed in the first 3 months after the enactment of this bill. All costs will be paid for by income taxes until all equipment is installed. 

Section 4:	 Self sustained energy will:

	•	It will improve the health of inmates since it will also serve as exercise;
	•	It will help inmates to contribute to something rather than just use up taxpayer money.

An Act to Abolish the Current State Policy of Free Hunt Days

Section 1: The current policy in South Carolina states that on December 26th-27th, 
one is permitted to hunt on these Free Hunt Days without a state hunting license or 
other required permits. Our bill is hereby abolishing these Free Hunt Days because 
they are unsafe, and put people at risk. 

Section 2: This policy allows inexperienced people to hunt, who are uneducated 
and are unfamiliar with the rules and regulations, which are necessary for safe 
hunting practices. Our bill is to help improve public safety and keep South Carolina 
safe. Right now, hunters who are unlicensed have the ability to hunt with 
dangerous firearms, which may cause severe injury, and possibly death to others.

hunt in this state, you must first pass a hunting safety training program. This 
program gives you extensive knowledge that you need in order to hunt safely, 
without putting yourself and others at risk. Hunting licenses provide money to 
maintain natural resources for the state and free hunt days allow people to hunt 
wildlife maintained by the DNR without actually funding the DNR.

Section 4: In conclusion, our bill will abolish these Free Hunt Days and help 
improve safety for all hunters. All normal hunting laws will apply; we are just 
prohibiting unlicensed hunting for the purpose of improving South Carolina hunting.

Section 5: When signed into Law, the Free Hunt Days for all years after 2015 will 
be abolished.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Decrease the Number of Drug Dealers in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:	Currently in the great state of South Carolina, scores upon scores of innocent drug possessing citizens are being convicted as drug dealers simply due to the amount of narcotics in their possession. The law states that if a person has more than eighteen grams of marijuana, then they will be tried and convicted as a dealer, even if there is no true intent to sell.

Section 2:	This bill will get rid of the “Intent to sell” conviction and individuals will just be punished for the possession of illegal narcotics. 

Section 3:	Drug dealers will still be convicted for their crimes. However, to be convicted as a “Drug Dealer”, an individual must be caught in the act of selling illegal narcotics or can be proven without a reasonable doubt to have sold drugs or be planning to sell drugs. These dealers will still incur the full penalty for the crimes, while allowing innocent citizens to receive due justice for their actions.

Section 4:	This bill when signed into law, will immediately get rid of the previously established “intent to sell” conviction, and all prisons serving time under these convictions will be either recharged on possession of illegal narcotics or released and will be decides by a judge on a case by case basis.

An Act to Deter Repeat Sexual Offenders

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, in South Carolina, there are roughly 14,000 registered sex 
offenders.  Offenders with a previous sex offense conviction have a 37% re-offense 
rate.  

Section 2:	 The state will offer incarcerated sex offenders the option of 
Surgical castration in exchange for a reduction their prison sentence by one half.

Section 3:	 The drastic drop in testosterone within the convicted offenders will thus 
decrease the re-offense rate.

Section 4: Though the surgical castration of an inmate will cost approximately 
$3,000, the annual cost of detaining one prisoner is $31,000.  The reduced prison 
sentences for the convicted sexual offenders will fund the cost of the surgical 
castration, reduce taxpayer money spent on maintaining prisons, and promote 
worker productivity in South Carolina.	

Section 5:	 When signed into law, the bill will take effect on February 14, 2016.

An Act to Change the State Animal

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state animal of South Carolina is the white-tail deer. This bill would change the state animal to Tavien Feaster, who is an animal.

Section 2: Any products that portray the white-tailed deer as the South Carolina state animal will be changed to portray Tavien Feaster.

Section 3: Humans are mammals and Tavien feaster is a human, therefore he qualifies to be the state animal. May it be noted that this bill does not have anything to do with race and this bill was approved by the Tavien Feaster.

Section 4: Tavien Feaster deserves to be the state animal more than the white-tailed deer. The following are reasons why Tavien Feaster should be the state animal:
	•	He has a career total of 2,881 rushing yards and 34 rushing touchdowns in 29 games played* and counting. The whitetailed deer has none.
	•	He has a career total of 2,185 receiving yards and 29 receiving touchdowns in 29 games played* and counting. The white-tailed deer has none.
	•	He is ranked 31st in “ESPN’s top 100” high school recruits. He is ranked as the number one high school recruit in the state and is ranked first in his position.* The white-tail deer does not qualify as a high school recruit
*stats as of September 25, 2015

Section 5: When signed into law, the change will take place on January 1,
2016.

An Act to Make Leaving Dogs in Cars Illegal

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: It is estimated that thousands of dogs die each year nationwide because dogs are left in cars on hot days. There is currently no law that makes that illegal.
 
Section 2: This bill will make it illegal to leave dogs in cars.
 
Section 3: In the confinements of a car, the temperature rises one degree (Fahrenheit) per minute. Therefore, on a 90 degree day, even with the windows cracked, in just 10 minutes the temperature can rise up to 100 degrees, injuring the dog. It follows that, in less than thirty minutes, the temperature could be as high as 120 degrees, which is fatal.
 
Section 4: The penalty for each offense is as follows-
	•	The first offense: $100 fine
	•	The second offense: Driver’s license suspended for four months, fine of $1,000

An Act to Abolish Vehicle Property Tax

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Eliminating the vehicle property tax will cut the total revenue of property tax down by 1/3. This will be paid off by raising the state sales tax from 6% to 8%.

Section 2: The state currently receives $744,109,074 per year from vehicle property taxes. The sales tax increase would create $1.2 billion in new revenue, eliminating the need for a vehicle tax.

Section 3: According to The Post and Courier 41% of South Carolina vehicle taxpayers are being charged an incorrect amount of taxes on their vehicles.  Some citizens are being overcharged for ownership of their vehicle.  Eliminating this tax would allow each South Carolinian to pay their fair share, without being over taxed.

Section 4: The sales tax increase would leave the state with an additional $455,890,926 of revenue, which will be distributed between the Department of Education and the Department of Transportation.

An Act of State-Wide Protection Against Domestic Violence

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:	Domestic violence is defined as an unlawful cause or threat of physical harm or injury to a household member. Recently, the domestic violence rates in South Carolina have doubled the national average, leaving South Carolina as the state with the highest ratio of domestic violence in the country. A woman is killed by a man every 12 days on average in South Carolina. South Carolina has been ranked in the top 10 of states with the highest domestic violence rates every year since 2000, showing that domestic violence is not just a short term issue. Something must be done to drastically change these statistics and we believe that this bill will greatly contribute to the declining of these ratios by creating more awareness about domestic violence throughout the youth of South Carolina using the public school systems and several different domestic violence help shelters throughout the different counties. This bill would also bring upon tighter regulations and stronger enforcement of the domestic violence laws that are already in place currently.

Section 2:	Under this bill, there will be a large non-profit organization created throughout the public school systems as well as any private or charter schools who wish to incorporate this organization within their school. This volunteer-based program would create a strong partnership between the domestic abuse shelters and the public schools, where weekly assemblies would be held at the school where speakers from these shelters would come to talk to the kids. These speakers could be those who have suffered from abuse and will teach the kids about the severities of domestic violence and what to do if you, or someone you love is suffering through this. This organization would be greatly beneficial by raising more awareness that is needed throughout the state and would protect all of those who have suffered/may suffer with domestic violence in the past or in the future. This bill would also put greater restrictions on the current laws about domestic violence.

Section 3: There are domestic violence shelters in Greenville, Pickens, Anderson, and Oconee county and the one that is partnered with your school is whatever shelter is closest to it in location. The further restrictions on the current laws are as follows;
	•	First offense- person found guilty is fined at a minimum of $2,000 and a maximum of $5,000 and put on probation for 6 months with mandatory counseling that the abuser must pay for himself.
	•	Second offense- Person found guilty fined at a minimum of $5,000 and a maximum of $8,000 and in prison no less than 1 year and no longer than 5 years, depending on the severity of the crime.
	•	Third offense- person found guilty in prison for no less than a 5 year prison sentence with a fine of a minimum of $10,000 and a maximum of $20,000, depending on the severity of the crime.
Half of all of the proceeds from the fines will go towards the domestic shelters and half will go to the state treasury where they will then be dispersed to wherever it need be.

Section 4: 	The only effects of the passage of this bill are positive ones. It will decrease the amount of domestic violence that happens in the state of South Carolina, raise awareness for domestic abuse, educate the youth of South Carolina about what to do if they have suspicions of someone they know is suffering from domestic violence and what to do if they themselves are suffering from it. It will not only raise awareness but it will also make the punishments more severe for the abusers and will have an amazing impact for the abused to turn their lives around.

Section 5: 	When signed into law, it will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Focus Prison on Rehabilitation

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Presently, America has about 25% of the world’s incarcerated people. We have the highest incarceration rate in the world, and over the last 30 years that number has increased over 400%. 41% of American juveniles and adults have been arrested by the time they’ve turned 23. Our prisons violate international standards with the use of solitary confinement, which increases instability and violence in inmates, and is considered by international law to be torture. Some institutions pay $100,000 dollars per year per prisoner, and $75 billon are spent per year in the US for prisons alone. 

Section 2:  This bill would seek to mandate that South Carolina prisons should decrease minimum sentences, entirely get rid of solitary confinement, and make rehabilitation the priority.  
Section 3: This bill would take the money that goes towards longer sentences and solitary confinement, and use it to fund educational centers, therapy, and drug rehab centers in prison. Prisons were initially made for rehabilitation, and these additions to the prison system will put it back on the road of rehab instead of punishment.

Section 4:  This bill would be enforced by the South Carolina Department of Corrections and the Department of Justice.  

Section 5: This law would go into effect after enacted as of January 1st, 2016.

Affordable College Act

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Since the year 1978 the cost of college has risen 1122% without real incomes having corresponding to growth. Tuition is growing at a greater rate than inflation; for example, in 2013 tuition and fees at private institutions rose by 3.7%, public institutions by 2.9 % and inflation, as measured by personal consumption expenditures index, rose by 1.4 % (2013 is the smallest increase in a decades for both the cost of tuition and inflation). Simultaneously, student loans are binding and unforgivable--even through bankruptcy and death. As a result, college is becoming an unattainable goal as is evident by a decrease in both enrollment and borrowing. Affordability must be examined as higher education is essential for employment, global competition, economic growth, and innovation.

Section 2: 
	•	The South Carolina Department of Education will explore other opportunities--such as European models-- to increase affordability and report those findings to both the President and Congressional Education Committees. 
	•	Legislative policy whereby any college or university in South Carolina to receiving state federal funds (directly or indirectly) may not raise its costs above the rate of inflation. 
	•	Reduce South Carolina Government’s profit on student loans by reducing.the interest rate for government backed student loans.
	•	Legislatively pass a law allowing students to refinance their student loans.
	•	Place a 4% cap on student interest rates that are through South Carolina government backed loans; for instance, rates could go lower, but not higher than 4%
	•	Legislatively pass a law allowing student loans to be forgiven in the case of bankruptcy or death.

Section 3:  A college education would be more affordable and South Carolina students would leave college with less debt. This will allow more young South Carolinians to receive the benefits of a college education and would improve the South Carolina’s ability to compete in the United States economy. 

Section 4: When signed into law, the first increase will take place on January 1, 2016.

Section 2: The funding from this will come from simply reducing the welfare budget in half. The surplus money will go into low sectors in the state like education.

Section 3: The current amount of welfare being received per year is 26,536 dollars. A South Carolina citizen with a minimum wage job is currently making 15,080 dollars a year (this yearly salary is based off of an average work year for an employee) which is 11,456 dollars more. This is a tremendous amount compared to minimum wage workers who actually have a job. Also due to welfare fraud a participant on welfare will not receive any additional benefits after the birth of the second child.

Section 4: Anything after the second child will not grant the participant extra money. If any welfare fraud is caught then the first offense will be a suspension for up to two years and the second offense will be a revocation of welfare benefits. 

Section 5This bill will go into effect on January 1st, 2017 in the state of South Carolina.

An Act To Require the Use of EpiPens in School

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: According to the CDC An estimated 9.5% of American children suffer from asthma, and between 4 and 6% of children are affected by food allergies, either of which can strike in an instant, and have life threatening consequences. The current South Carolina law states that EpiPens are allowed to be used in South Carolina schools, but are not required.

Section 2: This bill would require all South Carolina schools to maintain a supply of EpiPens, train an amount of personnel in the use of them, and allow them to use the EpiPens in an emergency. 

Section 3: In 2013, President Barack Obama created a law that gave schools which require schools to maintain an emergency supply of epinephrine (EpiPens), permit trained personnel of the schools to administer epinephrine, and for develope a plan to ensure trained personnel are available to administer epinephrine during all hours of the school day, preference in asthma- related grants. This means that implementing this bill would create a cost that would then be offset with the amount a school received from those grants.

Section 4: Schools will keep one EpiPen for each student with an allergy on file in a safe container and an additional two EpiPens will be stored in case of any other emergency. These will only be able to be accessed by authorized personnel. 

Section 5: When signed into law, schools will need to begin personnel training immediately and will be expected to implement all parts of this bill on or by January 1, 2016.

An Act to Increase Tax on Cigarettes

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state tax on cigarettes in South Carolina is 57 cents per pack. Our state has one of the lowest taxes in the country on cigarettes. We currently rank 43rd out of all the states in the U.S. 

Section 2:  We will be raising the tax on cigarettes by five cents annually until it reaches a cap of two dollars. 

Section 3: On average, 38% of South Carolinians are active smokers. The goal of this bill is to make this number go down. By raising the tax on cigarettes to two dollars, it will make many people reluctant to buy them. This will lead them to a safer choice of nicotine patches

Section 4: By raising the tax on cigarettes, tax on nicotine patches can be lowered. The nicotine patches’ tax being lowered will encourage citizens to make a healthier choice. Our goal is to make the number of people smoking in the state less than 10%. 

Section 5: Smoking is responsible for the death of approximately 7,200 citizens annually. 103,000 citizens are estimated to die from smoking prematurely. By enacting this bill, South Carolina’s percentage for death caused by smoking will decrease. Citizens are encouraged to make healthier choices ultimately leading them to stop smoking.

Section 6: If passed, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Require a set of Textbooks in Every Classroom in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Textbooks for a single student in high school costs approximately $500.85. This is causing a lot of the money that can be used on other problems to be spent on textbooks.

Section 2: Each class should be required to carry a class set of textbooks. This will allow students to not be required to carry their textbooks to and from class. Instead, students will come to class each day and use a textbook from the class set. 

Section 3: It will also decrease the amount of money needing to be spent on them because textbooks only need to be provided for individual classrooms rather than each individual student. Instead of printing and replacing textbooks for each student every year a significantly less amount need to be printed. This saves the state more money to use in other areas.

Section 4:  At the beginning of the school year a passcode and website will be given to each student which provides them access to the online textbook. The textbooks used in SC are provided online. The student can use the online textbook from home to complete assignments. Students who do not have access to internet access at home may check out a textbook from their classrooms or libraries to take home for the night.  

Section 5:  If passed, this bill will eliminate personal textbooks. Instead of checking out textbooks for the year, textbooks will only be available online, in classrooms, or the library. If a student needs a textbook to study at home and has no access to the Internet, he or she can check out a textbook from the classroom or the library for the night.

Section 6: When passed, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2017.

Section 3:	School employees should be able to carry concealed weapons because after school resource officers, they are the next line of defense to protect students, faculty, and themselves. There are not enough school resource officers to protect every single person in a school.

An act to limit the amount of vaccine (Time and Dosage) given to child that are required to be admitted into a South Carolina Public school

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends getting 28 doses of 10 vaccines for kids aged 0 to six. No US federal laws mandate vaccination, but all 50 states require certain vaccinations for children entering public schools. Most states offer medical and religious exemptions; and some states allow philosophical exemptions. (Procon.org) They believe children’s immune systems can deal with most infections naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a child may cause side effects, including seizures, paralysis, and death. They contend that numerous studies prove that vaccines may trigger problems like autism, ADHD, and diabetes. (ProCon.org)

Section 2: In the State of South Carolina there are nine vaccines a student must have to admit into a public school. Although these vaccines are valuable for the health and well-being of all, the rapid administration of these vaccines is dangerous and can harm young growing children.  The preservatives and viruses contained in vaccines could cause a reaction and change the child’s life forever.  A baby’s body needs time to develop. By the time the body is two, the body is growing rapidly. The brain is a fragile part of the body and by sending multiple vaccines in a fast pace of time filled with harmful ingredients into a child immune system is just wrong. 

Section 3: The schedule of vaccinating children shouldn’t be rushed. The process of putting the vaccines into a child’s body should not be standard for all children.  The schedule should be decided on by the pediatrician guided by a child’s response the government has no right to determine what and when we put into our children bodies.  By allowing the right for the parents and doctors to determine when the child should receive the vaccines will lower the side effects of vaccines. The intervals for many of these vaccines are a mere two to four weeks. This can be toxic to vibrant growing cells in the bodies of our children.

Section 4:  By allowing more time for vaccines to take place and to have a choice on the amount of vaccines will lower the amount of side effects in South Carolina. We would limit the amount of vaccines given to a child from a minimum of 6 month intervals.

Section 5: When signed into law, the bill will go into effect January 2016.

Section I:	This bill will offer an incentive for rescue dog and cat adoptions thereby reducing the number of dogs and cats put to death, and trying to control pet overpopulation by limited breeder fees and regulation and offering a state income tax deduction for rescue dog and cat adoptions.

Section II:	People adopting a rescue dog or cat from a state or county animal shelter/kennel or humane society or other authorized animal shelters can receive a state income tax deduction of up to $750 for the adoption expenses of a fixed cat or dog.

Section III:	This would require breeders who produce over 5 cats or dogs in a calendar year to be registered with the state of South Carolina, be licensed by the state and that they are required to pay a fee of $10 per dog sale and $5 per cat sale to offset the revenue lost for the tax deduction for rescue cat and dog adoptions. Also, requiring breeders to microchip and registered to all owners of dog and/or cat sales.

Section IV:	Also, to offset the cost of the tax deduction breeders would be required to pay a licensing fee of $100 for 6-15 dogs or cats and from 16-30 would be a cost of $250 and anything more than 30 dogs or cats would be $500 per year. This would also fund an office of breeder inspectors to insure the safety and humane treatment of the dogs or cats.

Section V:	Any person convicted of dumping dogs and/or cats can be charged criminally and/or fined up to $500 dollars per animal which would also go to the funding of the breeder inspectors and the state.

Insurance will cover the lowest possible product price, and the policy carrier can either buy the lowest stock brand for free, or a brand higher than the lowest priced brand, and will be compensated for the amount of the lowest priced brand (similar to a co-pay).

Section 3: Those unable to afford healthcare, thus unable to get free feminine product, would be eligible for Medicaid, which does cover feminine products. The basic healthcare premium will not adjust. The money used to cover the products will be included in the normal insurance yearly cost from the carrier.

Section 4: Compensation for feminine products would

The amount of money spent on gas will also decrease because motorcycles get more miles to the gallon and motorists will not be idling while in traffic.  This decrease in time spent idling will therefore decrease emissions

Section 5: All accidents involving a car and a motorcycle will be at the fault of the motorcyclist if lane splitting is suspected to be involved. The motorcyclist is aware that he is lane splitting at his own risk.

Section 6: Legalizing lane splitting will not require any funding.
 Section 7: When signed into law, lane splitting will be legal in South Carolina immediately.

An Act to Increase Food Donations

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: On average, SC grocery stores, restaurants, and supermarkets throw away 229,274 tons of edible food each year. This food is deemed perfectly acceptable to eat; however it is thrown away because consumers may not want it. 

Section 2: Upon enactment of this bill, SC will mandate that food corporations (Ingles, Publix, Chickfila, etc.) with more than 500 employees must donate unsold food, still acceptable for consumption, to a charity (homeless shelter, soup kitchen) of the manager’s choosing.

Section 3: Each individual franchise will be responsible for ensuring that unsold food be donated to a charity. Two months after the passage of this legislation, the manager must provide proof to local legal offices of entering a pact with a charity. 

Section 4: If the agreement and/or proof of the agreement is failed to be provided, a $1500 fine will be enforced. 

Section 5: In order to regulate this piece of legislation, the director of the charity may contact the manager of the franchise. If problems (no food donations) persist, the charity may contact local law officials who will then carry out an investigation. 

Section 6: If the franchise is found guilty of throwing away large quantities of food, the franchise will be fined up to $5,000 - all of which will go to the charity of which the agreement was formed with. If a second offense occurs, the franchise will be fined $6,500. Third offense will be $8,000. Fourth offense will result in a $10,000. Every offense thereafter will result in a fine of $1,000 greater than the one before. 

Section 7: If, for whatever reason, the franchise does not have food to donate for an extensive length of time, the manager must contact the charity’s director to explain. 

Section 8: Benefits from this bill include: 
	•	Better relationships between charities and large food corporations.
	•	Those in need will have a better chance of receiving food.
	•	Food will not be wasted.
	•	South Carolina will reduce its carbon footprint.
 Section 9: After passage of this bill, this piece of legislation will go into effect immediately.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Remove Smoking in a Car With Individuals Under 18

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The state currently has no laws which may prevent an individual from 
smoking in a car with someone under the age of 18. A law against this action needs 
to be created and enforced due to the fact that the individual has not reached an age 
in which the state recognizes the right to smoke due to the health risks it may impose. 
Therefore it appears irrational that a minor may suffer the medical consequences of 
smoking when they did not have the right to make the conscious decision of accepting 
responsibility for smoking.

Section 2:	The state should enforce this law through city and state law enforcement 
by giving such officials the authority to pull over an adult whom is smoking with 
others in the car to verify the age of those in the car if the officer feels that there 
may be a safety risk to passengers in the vehicle.

Section 3: Because such a law is simple to abide by, the states shall establish fines 
for individuals in violation with the law to pay, depending on the number of minors 
in the vehicle. These fines may range from $500 to $1,000 following the degree of 
offense.

Section 4:	 Revenue from this fine would fund and create:
	•	Cancer research for the effects of smoking on the body and environment
	•	Support groups to beat smoking habits
	•	Appropriate advertisements of the law and its effects
 Section 5: When signed into law, the fines shall be implemented on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Prohibit Tanning Beds

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In South Carolina the law that minors under 18 may have parental consent to use tanning beds will be changed to prohibiting any and all minors from the use of tannings beds. 

Section 2: The UV rays in tanning beds cause 86% of the current skin cancer deaths. Prohibiting minors would cut the percentage in half. 

Section 3: Users of tanning beds would have to show a driver’s license or other form of government-issued identification with a birth date and photograph. Tanning facilities that allow people under age 18 to use tanning beds and the minor using the tanning could be fined a minimum of $250 per violation. 
 Section 4: The use of a tanning bed increases the chance of cancer by 22% every time it is used. Prohibiting minors from using tanning beds will hopefully cause more people to also not do it later in life when they turn 18 keeping the percentage of skin cancer and deaths low.

An Act to Rehabilitate Offenders in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  	The state of South Carolina should institute reforms to focus on rehabilitation of minor criminal offenders. 
	Rehabilitation principles include:
	•	Substance and drug counseling.
	•	Workshops to teach and reinforce acceptable social behaviors.
	•	Psychological care to prisoners suffering from mental disease.
	•	Classes to educate prisoners how to write a resume and apply for a job after their sentence is over. 
	•	Let people out on early paroles. 
  
Section 2:	The state should a lot 15 million dollars to fund these activities. 

Section 3:	Because the budget for the Department of Corrections was recently cut $32.9 million, or 9.8 percent, there is an adequate need for funding to encompass the prisoners.  However, if rehabilitation was enforced and earlier parole was granted the state could spend $3.42 dollars a day per person instead of the $79 spent daily to provide for an inmate. 

Section 4:	Revenue from this tax would fund and create:
	•	The programming as mentioned in section 1.
	•	Less crowded and cheaper prisons. 
	•	A lower rate of unemployment.
	•	Less government and welfare supplied to ex- cons. 
 Section 5:	When signed into law, the first increase will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Require All South Carolina High School Graduates to Become Certified in the Usage of CPR and AED Devices

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1:  Every year, almost 92,000 people are saved by CPR. And for every sudden cardiac arrest, if immediate CPR and early defibrillation by an AED are used, the ill person has double the chance of survival they did.  But, only around 32% of people who suffer from sudden cardiac arrest have CPR performed on them by a bystander, because most people do not know what to do.  
 
Section 2: The purpose of this bill is to educate the graduates of South Carolina high schools by giving them the knowledge of how to perform CPR and use an AED, and possibly save someone’s life.
 
Section 3:  South Carolina will require all high school graduates to complete a Red Cross certified CPR/AED course before they graduate; it will be a necessary course requirement, and act as a credit on their transcript. They will take the class either junior or senior year.
 
Section 4:  No matter what form of school a student is in, it is a requirement to be a South Carolina graduate.  If they are a part of the list that follows, they must take it:
                   A. Public School
                   B. Private School
                   C. Online School
                   D. Homeschooling
 
Section 5: All schools will be required to provide a minimum of 4 days throughout the year where sessions occur. A student will only have to attend one, as the entire course will be done within that one day span. All students will have to say beforehand which day they are coming to, so that the adequate number of equipment and curriculum will be on hand. Homeschoolers and children attending online school can call the public school for which they are zoned and schedule the day in which they will come in, as to give teachers a better count of who will be attending.
 
Section 6: The course will be taught by Red Cross certified CPR/AED instructors.  If a teacher of the school happens to be one, they can teach the course with approval from administration and full, up to date credentials. 
 
Section 7: The bill will cost South Carolina, because of the fees of the curriculum and what encompasses that.  To offset the cost for public schools, a tassel will be sold by the school for those who complete it and graduate. Schools will determine the price of the tassel as is fitting to their number of students and price of what they have to pay. Private schools can go along with the tassel or simply ask for a payment from the students.  Homeschoolers and children in online school will pay the $20.00 fee to attend the public school’s class for the day.
 
Section 8: Schools and the students must participate in this initiative.  If they fail to provide the proper number of days, the district superintendent will have to meet with the school board and decide the appropriate punishment for that school. Students who do not go to any of the assigned school days must take it upon themselves to find a Red Cross class to attend, or they will not be eligible for graduation. 
 
Section 9: This bill will be put into effect in the following school year, 2016-2017.

An Act to Improve Caregiving Youth's Access to Education 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 Section 1: Currently, if a student is the primary caregiver of a family, and misses school to provide for their family members, it is counted as an unexcused absence.   Section 2: This will be changed to allow primary caregivers to help take care of those that need it. High school students, at or over the age of 16, must come forward to their high school guidance counselor with note or appearance from a social worker, a physician, or a pastor to establish the student's role as a caregiving youth.   Section 3: Caregiving youth will be allotted twenty more days for the purpose of providing for their family members in need. These will not be counted against the ten absence days students are already provided. However, in order to make up the time that they have missed, caregiving youth must either participate in seat time recovery or they may attend a lunch and learn meeting run by volunteers. Caregiving youth, in order to have an absence counted against these twenty extra days, will have to provide some form of documentation as proof of their taking care of the family member. This includes but is not limited to a doctor's note, a hospital notification, medical personal note, etc.   Section 4: The lunch and learn program will be similar to a tutoring program specifically for caregiving youth. Students will sign in each day and have that lunch period count towards one period they missed during a prior school day. Each lunch-in day will be designated towards a different subject, with the core classes of English, math, science, and social studies covered, as well as a day dedicated to electives. Schools will be able to decide what days are dedicated to what subject, as well as select volunteers to run the program.

A Reform on the Seat Time Recovery Laws

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill would give all high school students the option of doing a community service or activity chosen by the teacher and pertaining to the class curriculum to make up missed classroom instruction hours. The teacher would give the list, if there is more than one option, to the parent(s) of students under 18 so they may pick which activity they want their child to do.This would enable all students to have the chance of redeeming seat time hours without having to pay.

Section 2: In many schools in South Carolina, such as Greenville Tech Charter High School, a version of this idea is already being implemented along with the available purchase of seat time recovery hours. For students at or below the poverty line in other schools throughout the state this option is not at their disposal and holds back many from passing the school year because they are not able to afford the cost of seat time recovery.

Section 3: This reform would make it possible for all students to be able to make up seat time recovery hours and pass into the next grade.
 Section 4: This reform will go into immediate effect upon the passage and signature of the Youth Governor.

An Act to Make Yellow Traffic Lights Flash to Turn Red

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill would make it required to change all traffic lights in the country to make them flash when they are green, changing to yellow. This will prevent many drivers from getting tickets, and crashes from occurring when fender benders slam on their brakes to stop for the yellow and red lights.

Section 2: This idea is implemented in many countries, such as Canada, Russia, Austria, Estonia, and Latvia. Some traffic lights in Pennsylvania illuminate the yellow light a few seconds before the green light turns off to give the warning of this light change. If this technique is already implemented in one part of the United States, it’s possible to expand it to the entire country, making both drivers and pedestrians safer nationwide. 

Section 3: Georgia Code §40-6-23 states that, “When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signals only with caution.” Most people are not aware of this and instead of, “proceeding with caution,” they stop at the yellow, which may cause a crash as some drivers may keep going on a flashing yellow, like they’re supposed to. 
Section 4: A flashing green light would warn many to slow down ahead of time, so other drivers have room and time to stop.

Section 5: When signed into law, the first traffic light changes will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Require Employers to Equally Provide Meal Breaks to All Employees

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Preamble: WHEREAS in the state of South Carolina there are no laws pertaining to the requirement of a meal break of any business establishment. WHEREAS the federal law, cited by the United States Department of Labor requires that if breaks are to be provided, short breaks be “compensable work hours” and employees are to be paid during these breaks but, Bona fide meals to serve as “not compensable” and are not required to be paid. WHEREAS there is not a federal law requiring businesses to provide employees with breaks.  Entitlement to be paid is by the dependency on working during the break. WHEREAS it is required in educational facilities to provide a meal break in the state of South Carolina. Statistically, meals are given at four hour increments, being served in the morning around eight and in the afternoon at twelve at these institutions.  WHEREAS it is of a human necessity, meal breaks provide the body with energy to perform any working task and to aid in an employee’s performance.  It is of a hazard to not give workers any sort of meal break on any time constraint. WHEREAS full time employment is defined as five days a week per eight hour shift.
 
Section 1. Definitions:
	•	“Meal Break” is a given period of time to an employee used personally for necessary purposes such as eating. 
	•	“Bona Fide Meal Break” is an unpaid meal break lasting thirty minutes or more.
	•	"Employer" means any person, partnership, for profit or nonprofit corporation, limited liability corporation, the State and its political subdivisions and their agents that employ one or more employees. As used in this definition, "agent" means any former supervisor or the employer's designee.(Title 1)
	•	"Employee" means any person employed by an employer. (Title 1)

Section 2. Employers are to provide all employees at least a fifteen minute break per every four hours worked.  Breaks are to be equal and non-discriminatory in any way.  Break equivalence is dependent on equivalent tasks. Extended and/or more frequent breaks in smaller increments shall be provided for disability purposes and shall not be a consideration to termination or discrimination to hire. Refer to SECTION 41-1-30, SECTION 41-1-20, SECTION 41-1-70, and SECTION 41-1-80.

Section 3. Will take effect within all South Carolina areas, such as, counties, cities, towns, etc. pertaining to all employers and employees of South Carolina

Section 4. Enforcement and administration will be provided by the South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Administration "SCOSH exercises jurisdiction over all private sector and state and local government workplaces within the state with the exception of: private sector maritime activities; employment on military bases; Savannah River and Three Rivers Solid Waste Authority private sector employment; federal government workers; and the United States Postal Service. SCOSH Compliance is responsible for the enforcement of its safety and health standards. Compliance officers inspect workplaces for hazardous conditions and issue citations where violations of regulations are found. Inspections may be the result of regular scheduling, imminent danger reports, fatalities, and worker complaints or referrals." (SCOSH). Regular funding will continue to be received to South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Administration as such and regulated by the agency itself.

Section 5: penalties result in a misdemeanor of noncompliance. The South Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Administration: OSHA will issue citations and impose fines and abatement dates for each alleged violation.  Fines are determined based on the seriousness of the alleged hazard: 'Serious' citations can result in penalties of up to $7,000. 'Repeat' and 'willful' citations can carry fines of up to $70,000. 'Failure to abate' citations can result in penalties of up to $7,000 for each day the alleged violation is not corrected, up to 30 days." If contested by the employers it is deemed that the employer may present his/her case in Administrative Law Court. It is by the discretion of the agency to comply to pursue any fines, cost of fines, etc.

Section 6. Enactment will go in effect within 30 days of ratification.

An Act to End Property Tax and Increase Sales Tax

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The standing Property Tax in South Carolina of 4% on legal residence up to 5 acres collected annually, 6% on personal vehicles (cars, boats, planes, motorcycles, etc) collected annually, 10% on other personal property collected annually, and the registration fee of passenger cars, 24 dollars collected the first two years would be abolished in South Carolina. 

Section 2: The State Sales Tax would increase from 8% to 10% for food and from 6% to 9% for other purchased goods starting in January 2016. Therefore causing a non food item which is $9.99 without tax to increase from $10.59 (with present 6% tax), to $10.89 (new 9% tax). There would be no exemptions from this Sales Tax (excluding food stamps, etc). This is efficient because the people paying a higher Property Tax usually consume more, therefore paying the same amount in Sales Taxes as they would have previously paid through both sales and property taxes. 

Section 3: Because this act would end property tax on all personal property, those who owned no personal property would receive an incentive from the government of 3% of their yearly income. Therefore, if you did not own any personal property and your yearly income was 50,500, when taxes were due you would get and incentive from the government of $1,515. The purpose of this is to give a sense of complete ownership on personal property not like you are paying rent.

Section 4: The increased Sales Tax would fund:
	•	Educational purposes
	•	Repair of roads
	•	Specific County projects related to individual South Carolina Counties
	•	Fund purposes Property Taxes funded prior to change. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the new law would take place January 21, 2016, the day after the 2016 Annual Sales Tax is collected in South Carolina.

Section 1: At 18, one has the right to vote and serve in the military. Therefore, if one at 18 is able to choose a potential leader and fight for the country which they love, than they should be able to purchase and drink alcohol.

Section 2: Anyone under the age of 21 sees alcohol as a “forbidden fruit.” Curiosity leads to more people drinking anyway. The drinking age being lowered to 18 would mean less curiosity because it wouldn’t be illegal. 

Section 3:  Countries such as Italy, France, and Greece have a lower drinking age and their countries seem to have fewer alcohol related problems. The current legal age for drinking has led to more alcohol related deaths than ever before.

Section 4: Benefits from the passing of this bill would be:
	•	Fewer alcohol related deaths.
	•	Fewer alcohol related crimes.
	•	Show signs of more responsibility and maturity.

Section 2: Raising the pay for teachers will decrease turnover and make South Carolina a more attractive option to young teachers, as well as experienced teachers looking to relocate. This would also make teaching a more competitive field; schools could be more selective of the teachers they hire. This directly influences the education received by students.

Section 3: Under this law, the minimum yearly salary for teachers would be raised to $40,000 per year, the national average. 

Section 4: This new emphasis on education would effectively make South Carolina more competitive in attracting educated people who are willing to invest in the state. It is a matter of reputation. Having higher paid teachers and therefore more educated people will attract more businesses and institutions to invest. 

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will become fully effective on August 1, 2016.

An Act to Abolish Tuition in Public Colleges

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 Section 1: Currently, the majority of college graduates leave school in debt. In order to end this burden on the young adults of our state, we are moving to make public colleges free of tuition. 

Section 2: As seen in many European countries, the tuition for students attending public colleges could be covered by income taxes. By shifting the current state tax brackets and percentages to the ones used by the federal government, there would be a sufficient increase in funds to pay for tuition. Funds from the LIFE and HOPE scholarships, funded by the SC Education Lottery, would be allocated to the payment of tuitions.

Section 3: In order to qualify for free tuition, students would need to meet a number of criteria. Students would need to be residents of South Carolina. They would need to be attending a South Carolina public college or university. They would need to maintain a passing GPA. 

Section 4: When signed into law, this bill will become fully effective on August 1, 2016.

An Act to Separate Church from State

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in the state of South Carolina, one must acknowledge a belief in a Supreme Being to hold any office. In article six, section two of the South Carolina Constitution it says, “Person denying existence of Supreme Being not to hold office. No person who denies the existence of Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution.” Section two of article six would be removed from the state constitution. 

Section 2: The state constitution will be amended so that section two of article six will be removed. This section will no longer be a determining factor for who holds office in South Carolina. This will help to create a further separation of church and state in South Carolina.

Section 3: This section in the state constitution does not allow people who choose not to acknowledge a Supreme Being from holding office. This section directly discriminates against these people and violates their first amendment rights. This amendment allows for people to not be discriminated against based on religion or beliefs. Section two of article six is a violation of the separation between church and state. This section also implies a person holding office must publicize their personal religious beliefs. By amending this, a person holding office would not have to share personal belief in a Supreme Being. 

Section 4: This bill will require no additional funding because this is an amendment of the state constitution. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Increase the Age at which Adults must wear Helmets.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state safety regulation for wearing motorcycle helmets says 
that adults over 20 don’t have to wear helmets. Our law would make all motorcycle 
drivers wear helmets.

Section 2: The state safety regulation would decrease the amount of deaths caused 
by motorcycle accidents. Recent studies show that a majority of motorcycle deaths 
occur in people 40 and over. The average age that someone dies at in a motorcycle 
accident is 41. So, if we changed the law so that everyone has to wear a helmet, we 
could reduce the amount of deaths significantly.

Section 3:	When signed into law, the change will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Remove Religious Test as a qualification to Run for or Hold Public Office

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: A “religious test” is currently required to be taken by anyone running for public office in the state of South Carolina. This bill prohibits the state of South Carolina to require a “religious test” to run for or hold any public offices. 

Section 2: According to Section 2 of Article VI of the South Carolina Constitution “No person who denies the existence of the Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution.” This is in direct opposition of Article Six of the United States Constitution which states, “No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” 

Section 3: This bill shall not affect any current public office holders rights and obligations to hold their current position. This bill will impact all those who run for public office in SC beginning with the 2016 elections.  Furthermore, this bill shall not give anyone running for public office any sort of unfair advantage.  Nothing in this bill requires the individual running for public office to hold any sort of belief in any Supreme Being.

An Act to Secede from The United States

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: The current state of South Carolina is part of the United States and will secede from the United States of America, to become its own country. 

Section 2: The state will secede in a time period of a month, beginning on December 1st, 2015.  Thus by January 1st, 2016 the state will stand completely independent. 

Section 3: Because secession will separate South Carolina from the USA, “slavery” will be brought back to boost the economy.  The slaves would be prisoners serving their sentence, and once their time is up they are free to go. 

Section 4: Benefits of this secession would be: 
	•	The secession will bring greater economic opportunities for South Carolina.
	•	Nationalism will become more prevalent, as South Carolinians take pride in their new nation.
	•	More revenue will come from the greater economic opportunities. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the state will completely secede by January 1, 2016.

An Act to Allocate Funds to Job Opportunities in Advanced Manufacturing and Transportation in Vocational Schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: South Carolina is experiencing increasing job opportunities in transportation and advanced manufacturing.  In fact, South Carolina’s manufacturing industry experienced 12 percent growth in output from 2001 through 2010.  Vocational schools are not adapting to this changing job market climate.

Section 2: The state will reallocate funds in vocational schools to accommodate for the increase in the labor market demand for advanced manufacturing and transportation.  Therefore, the act would require no funding.  Since the majority of the distribution of funding for education is determined by individual districts, individual districts will also reallocate funds in vocational schools.  However, at least a seven percent reallocation of funds in vocational schools to education in transportation and advanced manufacturing is required.

Section 3: While some funds will be reallocated, the remaining funds will still be used in the status quo.

Section 4: The reallocation of funds would result in:
	•	Filling the demand in the labor market.
	•	Decrease the unemployment rate.
 Section 5: When signed into law, the act will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

Section 3: This is important to do because it will provide more coverage for those who cannot pay for it all themselves. 

Section 4: For the first three years that this has been passed for South Carolina the Federal government will pay 100% of all the cost for Medicaid, after those three years the Federal government will pay 90% and the State will pay 10%. This is not a financial issue since we already have that money available to us. Also people will pay through something called cost sharing, this is where people will pay a percentage of what they owe and Medicaid will pay the other portion thus helping with the overall state percentage cost.

An act to allow foster children over the age of 15 to be involved in the decision making for placement.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current law does not allow foster children to be involved in their foster placement home. The current law does allow a child to choose a family member to live with, but if no family member is available; children are placed with a foster family strictly chosen by DSS.

Section 2: The new law would allow foster children over the age of 15 to be involved with their placement. The foster child would be allowed to interview potential families for placement. After this law is passed children who are already placed with foster families will have to give proof on why they should change foster families. A case would be opened and the decision will be made, but foster children would have the right to approach the court with their concerns and suggestions.

Section 3: The following criteria will be necessary before a child can have an opportunity to be involved with their placement: 
	•	The child cannot be diagnosed with a mental illness.
	•	The child cannot have a history of violence.
	•	The child cannot have any misdemeanor and criminal charges.
	•	The child would need to have at least 2 recommendations from reliable sources.
	•	The child would need to present valid reasons for their recommendation or change in placement.

Section 4: This new law would have multiple benefits. 
	•	Currently, __ % of foster children in the state of South Carolina are or have been classified as a runaway.
	•	The children would gain confidence knowing they participated in the decision for their placement.
	•	This would also help more foster children find more permanent homes.
	•	This would reduce the instances of trouble within the foster homes, because the foster children would have suggested the placement.

Section 5: When signed into law, the first children will take place on January 15, 2016.

Driver’s Test Again…?

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In the state of South Carolina you are required to renew you Driver’s
License, but NOT retake your Driver’s Test. I believe that this practice is outdated and 
potentially dangerous to other drivers on the road. I propose that every five years,  
South Carolina Citizens should retake their Driver’s Test to insure that they are 
following all state laws and regulations and are practicing safe driving daily.

Section 2: Taking the test every five years would give more money to the state 
because in order to retake the test you would be charged a testing fee of $12.50. If 
the state government put a tax on the dmv for the quinquennial testing (government 
can only tax on the retesting fee), it would give them a little chunk of money and we 
are always looking for that. The State government could implement a .05% tax rate 
towards the dmv’s $12.50 they make per citizen that has to retest. That would give 
our government 0.625 cents per person. South Carolina (in 2014) had the population 
of 4.832 million people and it is still constantly rising. That tax towards the amount 
of people would give our State Government 3,020,000 million dollars every five 
years!  

Section 3: South Carolina is rated second to worst by Car Insurance Comparison and 
that is a problem I think we need to fix. South Carolina is ranked number eight in the 
nation for fatalities in wrecks that involve alcohol. 40% of the 767 crash fatalities last 
year involved an impaired driver in one of the cars. We are ranked number five in the 
nation in careless driving.  We are ranked number fifteen in the nation for speeding 
contributing to fatalities in car wrecks. 40% of people that are involved in fatal car 
wrecks weren’t wearing seatbelts. In order to cause less laws and regulations from 
being broken and to stop careless driving from occurring we need to put retesting 
into effect! Making the retesting a new law, would benefit us all because it would give 
South Carolina Citizens the knowledge again and help them to remember that laws, 
regulations, the traffic signs, and all of the things not to do while driving. It would 
help us to practice safer driving and for us to go up in the rankings as well. It would 
defiantly cause the fatalities to occur less as well. The retesting would refurbish our 
brains with the knowledge we need to know to practice safer driving and if you fail 
the test it looks like you won’t be driving till you pass! This would keep safer drivers 
on the road and not so safe drivers off the road. All of this retesting would cause the 
statistics I mentioned in the beginning of this section to change. Plus, it would give a 
tax to our state government which would be great because hey, who doesn’t like 
money? This would be a really good tradeoff for our government and cause a safer 
economy for our citizens.

Section 4: It would be funded by the citizens of South Carolina because they would
have to pay to retake the test and then government would receive a tax from the 
dmv’s allowing them to make money off of it. The $12.50 paid from a single citizen 
to the dmv, would be taxed by our government, and that would give them .0625 per 
person since they would be taxing 0.05%. Safer driving, less fatal wrecks, and money 
paid to the dmv’s and taxed by the state government, would make a safer and more 
stable economy. This would be a win win for the state of South Carolina.

Section 5: If/when signed into law, the retesting would begin on January 1st, 2016, 
and would be for anyone who needs to renew their Driver’s License and then they 
would start the cycle of the quinquennial process of retesting to improve safer roads. 
It would continue on for every one throughout the year and whoever needs to renew 
then needs to retake. Then five years later the retesting would take place again. 
(license needs to be renewed yearly though).

professionals need to be trained to recognize even the most minimal signs that a 
person may be a victim of human trafficking.

Section 2: Healthcare professionals in South Carolina must be trained to safely

the state.

Section 3: This act will be funded by raising the cigarette tax by $0.50 and raising

class will dismissed from further work until class is completed. Future health 
professionals will be required to take the course prior to starting work.

levels of protection for crashes involving motor vehicles (69%) and crashes from all 
other causes (68%). Injuries to the upper and mid facial areas are reduced 65%. In 
1980, South Carolina used a partial helmet law; requiring ages 21 and under to wear 
bicycle helmets. In the midst of this law, 13 lives were saved in our state. This also 
saved us $27 million. In 2010, motorcycle injuries resulted in 751 hospitalizations 
and 2,963 emergency department visits with over $73 million in hospitalization and 
emergency room charges.

Section 4:  Revenue from motorcycle helmet protection would fund:

An Act to Require Labels for all Foods Containing GMO’s

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: A GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) is any organism that is the result 
of a laboratory process where genes from the DNA of one species are extracted and 
artificially forced into the genes of another.  This relatively new science creates 
unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes that do not occur in 
nation.  GMOs are found in 80% of foods across the United States.

Section 2: There are no current restrictions placed on products containing GMO’s in
South Carolina or the United States, but many similar bills have been adopted in 
various States across the country. 

Section 3: The bill would require any food containing one or more genetically 
modified ingredients to be labeled as such.  The label would be uniform across all 
products and brands.

Section 4: Exemptions form this bill would include restaurants, bake sales, alcoholic 
beverages, as well as meat, dairy, and eggs from animals ONLY if the animals 
consume genetically engineered foods and are not themselves genetically 
engineered.  

Section 5: Citizens and visitors to South Carolina deserve to know what is in the 
food they eat.  This “Right to Know” Act would help those in South Carolina make 
healthier food decisions and would encourage other states to require GMO labeling 
as well.

Section 6: When passed, this Act would go into effect on May 31st, 2016.

Section 1: The current state lunch menu provides options that must follow the

sure there are no animal products included, such as no dairy or meat products.

	•	Provide every student an option based on their lifestyle choices

Section 5: When signed into law, the option of vegan food would be available in 
school lunchrooms in August 2017 when the school year begins.

An Act to Stop Standardized Testing to Get Into College

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: One in every five thousand students who take the SAT earns a perfect 
score.

Section 2:	 Students want to succeed in their academics. They work hard all year 
long and they have to worry about a test that can determine their college future. Half 
of students participate in extracurricular activities. They stay up late at night trying 
to cram all of the material that they learned that day and have to maintain a C 
average to stay on any sports teams. A really big issue is that some students have 
disabilities. Some students have dyslexia, ADHD, and ADD. The SAT and ACT 
shouldn’t determine whether or not you get into the college of your dreams. A GPA 
should tell colleges whether or not you are smart enough to get into that college.

Section 3:	 Standardized tests do not accurately measure students’ performance on
any given day.

Section 4: The removal of standardized testing would:
	•	Stop teachers from rushing through the material and allowing them to teach at a pace where students can understand the material.
	•	Stop funds to schools that do extremely well on standardized testing. 
	•	Eliminate pressure by making their students learn all the material and trying to pass a test.
	•	Eliminate stress on teachers, students, and school districts.

Section 5: When signed into law, this act will take effect immediately.

An Act to Implement Training Courses for Teachers to Improve Classroom Atmosphere Quality.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Frequently, teachers in classrooms are not up to date on the newest techniques for teaching children to thrive in and out of the classroom. This bill proposes training courses that would allow teachers to obtain the skills to handle social situations that may not be directly tied to education but would affect students personally.

Section 2:	 Currently, South Carolina does not offer training courses for handling difficult social situations. In order to implement this course at the beginning of each school year, funding will be set aside by each school district.

Section 3:	 Because teacher’s schedules are very hectic leading up to the beginning of the school year, multiple training days will be provided. Although there are optional dates to attend training, attendance to one training session is mandatory. Multiple training dates are provided to stress the importance of this training.

Section 4:	 These training sessions will:
	•	Focus on different social scenarios that may occur in students’ lives to help teachers understand the students’ viewpoint.
	•	Teach teachers how to correctly discipline students without affecting the student personally. 
	•	Improve teacher/student interactions and make the teacher seem more approachable.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will take effect for the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Regulate Power on Hand Dryer Machines

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill will require all hand dryers to have certain power or wind pressure.

Section 2:	 This bill will ensure that all hand dryers in South Carolina have a certain power so that they dry hands properly.

Section 3:	 Currently, hand dryers range from having no power to having too much power. Most people don’t wash their hands after using the bathroom just because they don’t want to take the time to wash their hands. This bill will make people more likely to wash their hands. This would cut the cost of having to buy paper towels as well.

Section 4:	 The state of South Carolina will buy all hand dryers that are currently in operation in the state of South Carolina. This purchase will allow businesses to purchase new, regulated hand dryers.

Section 5: This bill will help the state of South Carolina to become more energy efficient, and it will also promote healthy habits. New hand dryers will help businesses to save money through energy savings. 

Section 6: When signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1st, 2016.

An Act to Require Study Hall Periods in All South Carolina Public High Schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in South Carolina, several public high schools offer a study hall period for students to complete homework and study. This bill will require all public high schools to make a study hall period available to all students.

Section 2:	 This bill will provide an opportunity for all students to have the opportunity to take a study hall period. High schools throughout the country are beginning to require study halls as well. This law will cut back on salary expenses by eliminating extra teachers. With a study hall during school, students who have after school activities (sports, jobs, etc.) will have a chance during school hours to get homework and studying done. 

Section 3:	 Some schools require students to take seven classes until their senior year. Up to three of those seven classes are non-required electives such as sports medicine, film criticism, sports marketing, etc. These electives and others like them are not required to graduate high school and may be replaced with a study hall period. 

Section 4:	 Students in a study hall period will be able to use the time however they choose. If they do not choose to take advantage of the time to study they can use the time to socialize or rest.

Section 5: If approved, public high schools in South Carolina will make a study hall available to all students, beginning with the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Grant In-State Tuition Privileges to Former, Long Term Residents of the State of South Carolina.  

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Under current South Carolina state law, only students who relocate out of state from the date of the offer of college admission through the date of enrollment in college are granted in-state tuition privileges.

Section 2:  This bill allows former, long term residents of the State to receive in-state tuition privileges.  In order to be granted such privileges, the student must have been a permanent legal resident of the State for a minimum of ten consecutive years during which that student was enrolled in a primary or secondary school in the State of South Carolina.
 
Section 3:  The determination of permanent legal residency for the minimum ten-year period shall be based upon existing laws and regulations governing the establishment of state residency.

Section 4:  The purpose of this law is to encourage students who have a strong connection to the State and who relocate out of the state for reasons beyond their control to return to the State to pursue their college education.  This law will benefit the State because it is anticipated that a majority of these students will choose to remain in the State after their college education is complete and will contribute to the welfare of the State as gainfully employed and productive citizens.

Section 5:  When signed into law, this bill will go in effect January 1, 2016.  It shall apply to all students enrolled in their final year of high school on that date.
