not have any laws concerning hate crimes, despite the fact that there were over 50 hate crimes reported in 2013 alone. South Carolina is notorious for its history of prejudice and hate-driven crimes, and according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there are 19 known hate groups in the state. Increased penalties for hate crimes not only deter smaller crimes such as vandalism or harassment, but according to a study done by the Anti-Defamation League, victims are more likely to report hate crimes if they know there will be a consequence. This bill will create harsher penalties for any misdemeanors or felonies classified as hate crimes. <h3>Section</h3> 2: A hate crime is defined as a crime committed with clear intent to harm a person or property due to their race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, or sexual orientation. If someone is found guilty of a hate crime, they will be subjected to a fine of 2,000 to 10,000 dollars, and/or a prison sentence of two years to life, depending on the severity of the crime. Additionally, all law enforcement agencies will be required to report any and all hate crimes to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). <h3>Section</h3> 3: States with laws such as this in place have not experienced large increases in prison sentences, refuting the argument that such laws would lead to additional costs or prison bloating. Instead, penalties for hate crimes lead to reduced overall crime and higher consequences for petty crimes that contribute to racist and damaging ideals. Any additional costs due to extended prison sentences will be covered by fines collected from criminal offenders. <h3>Section</h3> 4: This bill will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). <h3>Section</h3> 5: Once signed into law, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Penalize Hate Crimes","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsRVucy6yAiOdOmnF","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops working due to a malfunction of electrical impulses, which can result in brain damage and death if not treated immediately. In these life-threatening situations, time is everything. A person whose oxygenated blood supply to the brain has been stopped can suffer brain damage within minutes and death in eight to ten minutes. The average first responder response time is eight to twelve minutes and every minute help is delayed a persons chance of survival decreases by ten percent. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Due to the small window of time, people must be able to react immediately and know the skills necessary to attempt to save a persons life. CPR, or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, is not only useful in these situations, it is also useful in heart attacks or some near drowning instances, in which a persons heart has stopped. Additionally, knowledge of how to use an AED, or automated external defibrillator, increases the chances of survival in situations where the victim's heart needs to be returned to a normal rhythm. In combination, these skills can save the life of a person in need. <h3>Section</h3> 3: A. In order to provide as many people as possible with these skills, this bill requires all high school students to take a course on performing CPR and AED usage. The course will be a part of the Physical Education curriculum.  B. Exemptions will be available for students with whose IEP or 504 states that he/she is not able to perform the tasks required in the course. Additionally, a doctors note advising of health problems that would cause an inability to perform the tasks required can exempt the student.  C. The district school board shall use an instructional program developed by the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, another nationally recognized program that teaches the most current CPR and AED methods, or a local medical professional, EMS, or other adult certified to teach the most current information by the American Red Cross.  D. This bill will affect all public high school students, beginning with the class of 2020. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Each school board will be responsible for the funding of their teaching method of choice. As long as the program complies with the guidelines set forth in <h3>Section</h3> 3, the district may choose whatever program is best for them financially and logistically. <h3>Section</h3> 5: As stated in <h3>Section</h3> 3, the class will be a mandatory addition to the Physical Education Program. This class is a graduation requirement in South Carolina. Failure to successfully complete this training will result in the withholding of the credit until the student completes the course. The certified instructor will determine if a student passes the training based on the most current standards.

This is roughly an average of $12,000 in business taxes and $4,300 in income taxes. This bill would allow new small businesses to be exempted from paying any taxes for one year after they open their business in the State of South Carolina, and their owners would be exempted from paying income taxes for one year. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  As stated by the United States Department of Labor, 80% of small businesses fail within the first 18 months. This bill would cut the taxes stated above to 0% for the first year after a business opens, and would exempt the business owner from paying income tax for the first year. According to financial analysts, a proposal like this would save the average small business owner in SC roughly $20,000 in taxes. It also predicts that this would raise the rate of small-businesses in the State of South Carolina by roughly 20%, adding at least $50,000,000 to our state revenue, within the first 3 years of this bill being enacted. This is supported by financial analysts, but also by former projections when South Carolinas economy grew by 3.4% in two years with a 3% decrease in overall taxes. This bill would allow many people in poorer areas of the state to make their dreams come true and open a small business while focusing on paying their lease or rent and building a client base. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  We will grow the economy by allowing more businesses to stay-open with the money saved from the decrease in taxes. We would also benefit as we would take the top ranking for Business Insiders best states for small business, which would help grow our population in addition to 4.5% growth we already experience. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  Overall provisions for this bill:   Small businesses would be tax exempt for one year after opening.   Owners would be exempt from income taxes for one year.   After the one year is up, they will pay 50% of the tax rate the second year, and will then return to pay the original taxes the third year.   Small business that pay their workers over $10.00 an hour will be given subsidies in an attempt to raise wages in the state.   The overall revenue gained would go towards infrastructure, education, and a government sponsored organization that helps create small businesses. <h3>Section</h3> 5: When signed into law, this new tax policy will go into effect on April 15th, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Allow New Small Businesses and Their Owners to be Tax Exempt for One Year after Opening","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsSAmlu2XQul9idow","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"Eastside High School","sponsor":" "},"-K3JsSLl0QFE1MawWayZ":{"author1":"Shelby Askins","author2":"Cristina Waingart","authorLocation":"not yet assigned","billLocation":"F","billStatus":"on the docket","billText":"<h3>Section</h3>1: Currently, in the state of South Carolina, there is no program available for students to have access to information missed in the classroom. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  When a student is absent from class, important information can be lost amongst the multitude of makeup work received when returning to school. Students also miss information in the class due to distractions and other mishaps. The recording of lessons will allow absent students to have the same teaching as if they were in classroom. Students who are misinformed or confused can access the teachings to provide clarity. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  Every classroom is required to have a live recording of the teaching for that day. The teacher will have a microphone; it will act as a remote that can turn the recording on and off, so that students can listen in on the lesson. The student will be able to watch the presentation using an application that allows a visual of the board with a podcast of the lesson. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  The program will only be accessed by students who have a school-provided student identification and password.

The applicant must pass a mandatory drug test. They must meet a legal age limit of 18 years. Persons that sign up for a license permit themselves to undergo mandatory STI tests on a weekly basis. Condoms are required to be worn by all male prostitutes and customers. A recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health reveals that of the combined 3,290 clients of forty different legal sex workers, not one received penetrative sex without a condom. This information contrasts greatly with the realities of street prostitution. Women working without the protection of brothel management are often intimidated or forced to perform these same services without the benefit of safeguards for their health. Persons that believe that they have contracted an STI from a prostitute may press charges if they provide sufficient evidence that they received the STI while obtaining the services from the brothel in question, and vice-versa. Prostitutes may only work within the confines of brothel in which they are employed. If any rules and regulations are not followed, licenses will be suspended until all rules and regulations are met. If standards are not met within a certain period of time, licenses will be revoked. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Businesses must be licensed in order to become a brothel. To acquire a license, a business must pay a licensing fee. The license will only allow for a certain amount of prostitutes to be employed at any one time.

PAS is at the request and consent of the patient, where the patient will self-administer the means of death.  In euthanasia, the doctor will administer the means of death. <h3>Section</h3> 2: To request a prescription for lethal medications, the Death with Dignity Act requires that a patient voluntarily express his wish to die and be:   an adult,   a South Carolina resident,   mentally capable, and   diagnosed with a terminal illness (incurable and irreversible) that will lead to death within twelve months. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Patients meeting these requirements are eligible to request a prescription for lethal medication from a licensed Oregon physician. To receive a prescription for lethal medication, the following steps must be fulfilled:   the patient must make two oral requests to his physician, separated by at least 15 days;   the patient must provide a written, witnessed request to his physician (two witnesses);   the prescribing physician and a consulting physician must confirm the diagnosis and prognosis;   the prescribing physician and a consulting physician must determine whether the patient is capable;   if either physician believes the patient's judgment is impaired by a psychiatric or psychological disorder, he must refer the patient for a psychological examination;   the prescribing physician must inform the patient of feasible alternatives to assisted suicide, including comfort care, hospice care, and pain control; and   the prescribing physician must request, but may not require, the patient to notify his next-of-kin of the prescription request. <h3>Section</h3> 4: An adult in the state of South Carolina will be referred to as anyone who is 18 years or older. <h3>Section</h3> 5:  \"Capable\" means that in the opinion of a court or in the opinion of the patient's attending physician or consulting physician, psychiatrist or psychologist, a patient has the ability to make and communicate health care decisions to health care providers, including communication through persons familiar with the patient's manner of communicating if those persons are available. <h3>Section</h3> 6:  Physicians and patients who follow the act's requirements are protected from criminal prosecution, and the choice of legal physician-assisted suicide cannot affect the status of a patient's health or life insurance policy. <h3>Section</h3> 7:  All laws or parts of laws in conflict with this bill are herewith repealed to the extent of the conflict. <h3>Section</h3> 8: If any portion of this act shall be declared unconstitutional, it is the intent of the Legislature that the other portions shall remain in full force and effect. <h3>Section</h3> 9: This bill will be implemented January 1, 2016","billTitle":"Death with Dignity Act: An act to legalize physician assisted dying","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsW4UoDY7un9Mz3Gw","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"Hammond School","sponsor":" "},"-K3JsWFJ7eKqWt2jINLh":{"author1":"Cle Pennington","author2":"Sumant Rao","authorLocation":"not yet assigned","billLocation":"F","billStatus":"on the docket","billText":"<h3>Section</h3>1: Currently in the state of South Carolina, the sixty judges that constitute the state Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Circuit Courts all are elected by the General Assembly, the state House of Representatives and the Senate. This is done through recommendation by the South Carolina Judicial Merit Selection Committee. In fact, other than Virginia, South Carolina is the only state to appoint judges based solely on legislative election, putting too much power in the legislature. Furthermore, of the 170 current members of the General Assembly, fifty, or around thirty percent, are active attorneys and thus argue cases in front of the justices that they chose to elect. This creates a political climate in which justices can become biased and thus make rulings not by evidence presented but by whichever legislator is arguing the case so that they will be reelected at the expiration of their term. <h3>Section</h3> 2: This bill will change the election of justices instead to slightly mirror the federal system to resolve the potential bias and imbalance within the current system. Thus, justices will be nominated by the acting Governor and subsequently approved by the South Carolina Judicial Merit Selection Committee. Then, the Governor's nomination will be confirmed by a simple majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Also, because this is simply a reform measure within the government to alleviate a corruption issue, there would be no need for funding or expenditure from the government. The reason we decided upon a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly is simply because a two-thirds majority is difficult to attain, which would still lead to justices having to appease legislators to get elected. With a simple majority, a consensus is more easily reached, alleviating justices with the pressure to appease certain legislators. Also, if the General Assembly rejects a judicial candidate, then that candidate is taken off of the ballot for the position since the Governor has no veto power in South Carolina, except for bills concerning budget. Thus, the legislature's decision is final. <h3>Section</h3> 4: As this bill is meant to curb judicial corruption, the bias and dependency of justices regarding specific legislators should decrease. However, the South Carolina Commission on Judicial Conduct is still responsible to seek out bias amongst justices, as it was designed to do, and administer punishment and trial as necessary. <h3>Section</h3> 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Change the Nomination and Election of South Carolina Judges","division":"Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3JsWFJ7eKqWt2jINLh","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"Hammond School","sponsor":" "},"-K3JsWQ2vl5-OCVEx-HJ":{"author1":"Caroline Zeller","author2":"Colleen Goff","authorLocation":"not yet assigned","billLocation":"B","billStatus":"on the docket","billText":"<h3>Section</h3>1: Any person found to be wearing an obnoxious amount of perfume and/or cologne will be fined. <h3>Section</h3> 2: To ease the sufferings of people with asthma and/or allergies, to keep the air clean of toxins similar to non smoking laws.

This act would reduce the SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act) tax rate to a flat and reasonable 1% with no drop-off after gross earnings capped after $200,000 per year versus $14,000. Introducing a flat tax would encourage increased employment on the part of businesses because the varying rates of the SUTA tax rate (0% - 7.855%) discourage higher numbers of employment. This is because whenever a business hires an employee, there is a possibility that said employee would have to be laid off at some point in time, causing the SUTA rates to go up for that particular business. <h3>Section</h3> 2: The problem of a varying and raised SUTA tax rate has been a detrimental encumbrance upon businesses for 7 years, and has cost businesses not only opportunities for growth and expanded employment, but has also cost businesses in South Carolina nearly a billion dollars due to SUTA Dumping (see <h3>Section</h3> 3). This problem's solution is in the form of a flat SUTA rate of 1% imposed on companies corporately held in South Carolina, as oppose to the average 3.91% rate. Another piece to this solution is imposing a slightly raised 2% flat SUTA rate on companies corporately held outside of South Carolina, such as Boeing or BMW. These flat and low tax rates will not only encourage corporations to relocate to South Carolina, but will reduce the amount of money lost due to SUTA dumping because the costs for SUTA dumping will outweigh the cost of actually paying the SUTA rate. <h3>Section</h3> 3: A major issue with the current system of imposing SUTA rates is SUTA dumping. SUTA dumping methods are ways that employers avoid a higher SUTA tax rate or the raising of their SUTA tax rate. Ways that businesses do this are Corporate Shelling and using the New Employer Rate. Corporate Shelling is when a company transfers its payroll to the purchased entity, essentially moving all taxable payroll assets to a new or undeveloped entity with a much lower SUTA rate. The New Employer Rate is when a company files a registration form requesting a new employer account number (Federal ID Number), essentially resetting their SUTA rate. These methods are the two primary methods of SUTA dumping, which create an uneven playing field amongst businesses and costs the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually. <h3>Section</h3> 4: The bill would essentially fund itself, as the money gained from increased taxable assets would go towards the state and in turn to DEW (The Department of Employment and Workforce), which enforces and upkeeps SUTA. <h3>Section</h3> 5: DEW (The Department of Employment and Workforce) will enforce the bill, and is currently paid for by the state employers, which would see an influx of revenue due to more corporately held taxable assets within the state of South Carolina. This surplus that our state would come into would allow for further expansion on the part of the state, thereby allowing more legislative acts to be passed and funded. <h3>Section</h3> 6: This bill would affect business in South Carolina in a tremendously positive way. Not only would the cost per-employee drop significantly, it would encourage outside business to migrate to South Carolina. It is no secret that companies like BMW and Boeing have brought major employment to South Carolina, and their influence on the state's economy has been conspicuously positive. The amount of similarly sized corporations that are present in the state would only increase, as South Carolina would be a place where businesses have real breathing room and can expand throughout the state, creating jobs and opportunities for all South Carolinians. <h3>Section</h3> 7: This bill will take effect on January 01, 2016.","billTitle":"SUTA Flat Tax Proposal","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K0xXlC853stA28ilZ","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

A 21-year old man shot ten people in a church, and nine of them died. Prior to this shooting, the gunman already had a criminal record. If this bill went into effect before this incident, this tragedy may have been able to be prevented. Our bill will require any person that wishes to purchase a firearm pass a mandatory background check. <h3>Section</h3> 2: The general idea behind background checks is to check individuals for any criminal or public safety record to prevent them from owning a firearm. We believe that this is legitimate because the state should not allow people with certain mental disabilities and public safety charges to possess firearms. Some may view this as interfering with our 2nd Amendment rights, the right to bear arms, but it is for the greater good and should reduce crime rates in South Carolina. A new study from Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research has found Missouris decision to repeal its law, requiring all handgun purchasers to pass a background check, led to a 16 percent increase in the state murder rate. People purchasing firearms would have their name run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check or NICS.Some may argue that the government cannot tell people which products they can and cannot buy, but this is also for the greater good of the public and if someone passes the background check, there is no reason they should not be able to purchase a firearm. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Funding for the background checks will come from an additional 1% tax on the purchase of firearms and ammunition. A statewide background check typically costs $10-20. Background checks are not free, but are cheap and easy to do. <h3>Section</h3> 4: Individual vendors will enforce the stipulations of this bill. If this became a law, they would be legally obligated to run background checks. If someone fails a background check then there will be no repercussions for those attempting to purchase a firearm. Appeals can be made if someone has a criminal record for a nonviolent charge (drug possession, minor in possession of alcohol, etc.). Appeals would be submitted to the NICS <h3>Section</h3> s Appeal Services Team and/or the state branch of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). <h3>Section</h3> 5: This bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to require a background check before purchasing a firearm.","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K0yQ-9uO2-M6Tho_2","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

For example, a survey conducted for the American Psychological Association, proves that 83 percent of teens said that school was a somewhat or significant source of stress. This bill is an attempt to reduce the level of stress on teens by permitting only one examination from each subject once a week. Basically each subject will be assigned a specific day to conduct examinations aka tests and quizzes. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  As mentioned in <h3>Section</h3> one, we are highly concerned about stress on students.  Students stress out over there grades. Our bill will fix this problem by allowing more time for students to study. In the state of South Carolina, all public schools will follow a certain examination schedule. A rough draft of the basic core subject schedule is: Mondays will be math days, Tuesdays will be science days, Wednesdays will be social studies days, Thursdays will be related arts day, and Fridays will be English days. This schedule does not include students taking more than one class in the same general subject, that can be determined by the specific school. Furthermore, this schedule allows students, teachers, and parents to be more organized as well as remain healthy, balanced lifestyles. However, if there is a need to make up any examinations that a student missed, then the make-up assessment can be taken on any day of the week, as long as it is prearranged with the teacher. Also, if there are days missed sue to national holidays/breaks and or bad weather (snow days) then teachers will be allowed to assign assessments any day on the prior week or the current week, as long as students have a two day noticed. We understand that teachers want to assign assessments whenever because they want to test our knowledge. Although, from a student perspective, it takes more time to fully understand the material so that it can help us in the long run. Specifically, students can focus on studying in one subject, instead of studying multiple subjects at once, as well as receive more time to study, so that it can be useful in real life. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  Our bill does not need to be funded, because all it takes is communication and enforcement. Once a final schedule is in act, teachers will then be left to plan lessons and examinations around a specific day. If the teachers dont follow the instructed schedule and assign examinations on their unassigned day, then students will be allowed to retake the same test on the upcoming assigned day. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  This bill will be enforced by the State Board of Education in South Carolina. Once this is put into place, the bill can be further enforced on a local level by districts. <h3>Section</h3> 5:  When signed into law by the governor this bill will take place on January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Lighten the Stress Level of Students","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K0zJVsKuqtfI_umS7","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

Studies show that, on average, teenagers need nine and a half hours of sleep to perform at their highest level of ability in school.Not getting enough sleep leads to an inability to listen, concentrate, and solve problems, which are basic activities that you are expected to be able to do on a daily basis in any learning environment.  On top of this, many kids have extracurricular activities after school. This is also very difficult for individuals who take classes that come with heavy workloads at night, such as honors and AP classes. From these reasons, we concluded that for students to get enough sleep to function at their maximum ability, the school starting time should be later. <h3>Section</h3> 2: We propose that school should start 1 hour later, at 9:45 am. Pushing the school start time back one hour makes up for the time difference between that average time and the amount that students should be receiving. If school starts at 9:45, that would push back the end time to 4:45pm. This time is convenient, as most parents have jobs that end around that time. With this start time, the average individual would wake up at 8:00am, rather than 7:00. This means that the average kid that goes to bed at 11:00 will get 9 hours of sleep, which will enable them to be able to better perform their daily tasks at school. With this new start time, students will not be as tired during classes, and they will likely be able to better concentrate and absorb the information they are being taught. This not only helps the students, but will also help the schools. With kids having a better ability to learn, it is only logical to assume that they would then get higher grades. With higher scores on tests, quizzes, and state/national assessments, schools would be much higher looked upon. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Unlike most bills, this bill can be put into effect without any additional funding.  It would involve altering teacher contracts to allow them to work at different times.  It would also change school bus schedules and cafeteria schedules, but it would run like a normal day, simply pushed back an hour.  That would mean there is no need for extra funding. <h3>Section</h3> 4: The South Carolina Board of Education, the main governing body of all public schools in South Carolina, will put this bill into effect for all SC public schools. <h3>Section</h3> 5: Our bill will go into effect the beginning of the 2016/2017 school year. school year.","billTitle":"An Act to delay the starting time of public schools","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K1-3VXBIDBcaSOPJw","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

Welfare is paid for by taxes. Unfortunately, this program is often abused by many people to purchase illegal drugs. This Bill would only be implemented for those who are receiving need welfare, not Medicare; the reason for this is because more people on welfare abuse the help they receive than on Medicare. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  In South Carolina, we have roughly 38,000 citizens on welfare. However, there are no laws that require an applicant to be subject to mandatory drug tests. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Drug tests for every recipient of welfare would have an estimated cost of $500,000 per month.

The state has been in the top ten on the list for the past decade and topped the list three times in this period. Over the last ten years, more than 300 women have died at the hands of a man in South Carolina. As far as domestic violence, 36,000 cases are reported annually in the state. And too many times murder and domestic violence are related. The state has done little to nothing to help either of these problems, as is illustrated by a steady homicide rate of women by men for the last 15 years. This bill will drop these frightening statistics by inflicting harsher punishments on abusers, and providing more ways for the victims to get help and feel safe. It will also lower the rate of women killed by men, as it would stop these men before they get to the point of killing their victim, as well as moving women to do something earlier because they know their state cares and wants to whats right to keep them safe. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Right now, in South Carolina, someone convicted of domestic violence has to be convicted three times before they are charged with a felony. On a first or second offense, they can be fined and put in jail for as little as thirty days. So after a month in jail, what is stopping them from returning to their old habits of abusing their victim(s)? This constant abuse is what leads the abuser to eventually commit murder. <h3>Section</h3> 3: Right now, in South Carolina, domestic violence is not a priority. Funding for this bill would come partly from sales taxes, but mostly from state funding. We need more ways for these women to get help. Unfortunately, there arent enough resources and domestic violence shelters (right now, 46 counties in this state have animal shelters, while only 18 have domestic violence shelters) for every request to get the help they need. Of the victims that dont get help, about 60% return to their abusers. The state would pay to build more shelters that provide care for domestic violence victims. This would include opening shelters in half the counties in the state that dont have them, as well as increasing the funding towards the preexisting shelters so that every plea for help can be met. Taxes from sales tax and property tax would go to any costs related to imprisoning the accusers. <h3>Section</h3> 4: We need stricter laws with stricter punishments for domestic violence crimes, so that women can finally feel free from the constant cycle of abuse they suffer through. Local Law Enforcement can enforce this bill by extending the amount of time in prison convicts spend and charge them on their first offence, not third. The cost for holding the guilty accountable would not be that large, but any additional costs involved in detaining and punishing the accused would come from taxpayer dollars. <h3>Section</h3> 5: This bill will be beneficial to our state for the following reasons:   It will contain people who commit domestic violence.   It will provide protection and safety for women who are victims of domestic violence.   It will decrease the amount of deaths and domestic violence rates committed in our state. <h3>Section</h3> 6: When this bill is signed into law, it will be taken into effect on January 1st, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Prevent the Homicide and Abuse of Women","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K11ISjEp4ktzyuBox","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

One reason that South Carolina has bad roads is because South Carolina has the fourth-largest state maintained road system in the United States, but the third-lowest gas tax to pay for the maintenance. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) has to maintain over 40,000 miles of roads, but South Carolina politicians rarely raise taxes. The states gas tax of 16 cents a gallon hasnt been raised since 1987. South Carolina has some of the lowest gas prices in the country. We propose to add an extra 5 cent tax per gallon to help increase the quality of our roads. Though this amount does not seem much, it starts to add up. This will cause people to spend money on gas instead of car repairs which will save people money in the long run. <h3>Section</h3> 2: 47% of the roads are considered to be in poor condition and 19% are considered to be substandard, according to fixscroads.com.  The average cost to repair a flat tire is $10 and this does not include the cost to repair dented rims or broken windshields. With damages to cars these amounts start to add up to a lot of money because of the poor roads that we are driving on. <h3>Section</h3> 3: There will be no need for funding for this bill as the tax will be added to the price of gas. This law will be enforced by every gas station in South Carolina. the penalty for the gas stations who do not enforce the law will be penalized with a fine of two thousand dollars every week they don't enforce the tax. <h3>Section</h3> 4: The benefits of this bill are:    We will have better roads. The tax will give SCDOT the money to improve the roads.    Cars will not get as beat up because of bad roads. This will help people not have to spend as much money on repairing their vehicles.    With better roads, SC will be able to attach more businesses, as quality infrastructure can be a key component for whether new businesses decide to open in SC, thus creating more jobs. <h3>Section</h3> 5: This bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Improve Our Roads","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K128IXm46FyMHsP0F","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

This bill would place a 15 cents tax per aluminum and/or glass bottle purchased in SC.  Examples of these items are soda cans, water bottles, beer bottles, and wine bottles or wine cooler containers. The revenue generated by this tax will be distributed as follows:  five cents to the store for collecting the recyclables, 5 cents towards funding public education in SC, and 5 cents towards improving SC roads. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Currently in South Carolina recycling is optional. Either participants pay taxes for it to be picked up (for example those who live in the city limits often pay higher taxes, but receive recycling) or citizens take it to a landfill or recycling center.  This law would incentivize all stores to purchase machines that process recyclable material in order to obtain the 5 cents return on each bottle/can. <h3>Section</h3> 3: The law will be overseen and enforced by the SC Department of Revenue who will distribute monthly checks to stores, the department of education, and department of transportation based on the amount of recycling received.  The recycling will be collected by the non-profit Palmetto Pride and any expense associated with the collection and drop off of recycled items will be taken equally out of the revenue generated prior to organizations involved being paid. <h3>Section</h3> 4: The justification for such an Act follows:   The state recycles 29.2% of its recycled waste. Because of this in effect in other states, there have a higher recycling percentage. For example, Californias population recycles 49%, Delaware is 40%, Michigan is 31%, and Vermont is between 30-35%    The roads in South Carolina are in terrible condition and the schools need to be improved so this new revenue source could help improve to important aspect of SC.  There are similar affective acts in other states such as California and Michigan.   South Carolina generates about 4.2 million tons of trash in landfills each year.

This bill will help the environment and it will incentivize people to want to improve the environment.   It will also help reduce the amount of waste generated.

Although there are many other options to consider about the fetus life, terminating the pregnancy is always a choice. To reduce the occurrence of abortion, a law should state that the mother must have a deadly condition that requires the need for the pregnancy to be terminated for the mother to survive, in order to receive an abortion. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  The bill will state that the mother needs to have a life-threatening condition to execute the abortion. If the mothers life is at stake and will die because of the fetus a trained doctor at an abortion clinic, hospital or private practice is allowed to abort the fetus. If the abortion is by medication the woman must have a prescription to obtain say Mifepristone. In South Carolina it is required that an abortion clinic has a license in order to practice abortion. Abortion clinics or any practice executing abortions will have to obtain a new license with a requirement to meet the new standard of only practicing on women with deadly circumstances <h3>Section</h3> 3:  In South Carolina public funding is already provided for abortion in pregnancies endangering the mother or that are a result of rape or incest. Rape and incest no longer will qualify the mother for an abortion. Without the need for the funding for rape victims or incest the funds previously provided for rape and incest will go to Department of Children and Family Services and Department of Health and Environmental Control. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  The bill will be enforced by the Department of Children and Family Services, OB-GYNs, Physicians, and any doctor taking part in the abortion. Doctors would be required by law to recommend or perform an abortion only if it is absolutely necessary for the mother to survive. If a doctor is found guilty of approving of the disposal of a fetus without need the doctor will be faced with criminal charges. If the mother is denied an abortion due to not meeting the medical requirements, then DSS will offer the mother adoption options and other places for the child to go once born.  The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control would enforce the requirement by requiring facilities to have on record every abortion and proof of a doctors approval. If the facility is unable to provide the necessary information then the Department of Health and Environmental Control would then be able to be shut down the business.  If any doctor or mother is aware or taking part in an unapproved abortion and neglect telling a government official, then they are to be punished according to the extent of the actions. <h3>Section</h3> 5:  This bill will go into effect January 1st, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Require All Abortions be Conducted Only When the Life of the Mother is at Risk.","division":"Premier Senate","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3K15CmBM2hdQ_aFIT0","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

For example, human cells from volunteers can be used for scientific and/or commercial testing of products. Artificial human skin can be made from sheets of human skin cells and is grown in test tubes. This can produce more useful and reliable results than animal testing. Scientists can experiment with human cells obtained from volunteers. They can use artificial human skin that is grown in test tubes using human skin cells. They can use virtual models of human molecular structures and predict the toxicity of substance. Another reason why human cells should be used instead of animals is because drugs that pass animal tests arent always safe or reliable. The last reason why we should not test on animals is because it is wasteful. Scientist put harmful chemicals on innocent animals. Either the experiment works or it fails, but what happen if it fails? They just throw the animal away! <h3>Section</h3> 3: Many non-animal tests, such as Vitro, have been compared to animal tests. Vitro has been proven to cost a lot less than animal tests. Vitro is the type of experiments that uses artificial organisms rather than animals that gives back even better results. For example, a rat phototoxicity test costs $11,500 but a Vitro test costs $1,300. These artificial organism tests would save a lot of money, enabling scientists to conduct more tests and experiments.

The penny tax would bring in about $3 million since about 300 million packs of cigarettes are sold a year in the state, so it would cover the expense. <h3>Section</h3> 4: It is the local school boards responsibility to oversee this requirement. The school must have 75% or more of the teachers certified by the end of the year the bill goes into effect.  If a school does not meet this deadline, the school board will issue a warning. If the school continues to violate the law, the school board will no longer renew the contracts of the administration at the school. <h3>Section</h3> 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.","billTitle":"An Act to Require CPR Certification for Teachers","division":"House of Representatives","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3KE1Hp37MBYtw_HoNy","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

Currently, South Carolina has the policy that prohibits the Open Carry of Handguns.  The law that we propose will allow the Open Carry of Handguns in South Carolina. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  Our bill proposes to make South Carolina an open carry state. Residents would be required to obtain a license to carry handguns in a holster, in public, which would include a background check.  There will be areas that will not allow firearms to be openly carried such as hospitals, schools, and religious places of worship.  Since 2010, there have been 20,000 robberies, and a gun related murder occurs approximately every 14 hours in South Carolina. Currently, of the 7 states that prohibit open carry policies, 5 are in the top twenty states for gun related violence, two being in the top 5. Open Carry laws deter crime, as criminals are less likely to attack or rob an armed individual.  It has been reported that 92% of criminal attacks are deterred when a gun is merely shown.  Also, if residents are familiarized with guns, they are more likely to be used in a safe, controlled manner. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  This law will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and paid for by a 5% tax on gun sales, which would pay for the licensing and background checks for those who apply. The penalty for those openly carrying a handgun without a license, or carrying any other type of firearm with a license (hunting is not included), will be ticketed, can have the firearm confiscated, and possibly arrested, which will be determined by the circumstances. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  After being signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1, 2015","billTitle":"An Act to Allow the Open Carry of Handguns","division":"House of Representatives","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3KE1zgTYI_S6iM3AvM","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"J.L.

These kits, typically called rape kits, are often stored away in law enforcement facilities and can only be tested if requested by a detective or prosecutor. This results in numerous kits remaining untested and accumulating in what is known as rape kit backlog, leaving many rape victims unaware of their attacker and awaiting justice for long periods of time due to a lack of legislature mandating the testing of their kit. <h3>Section</h3> 2: There is currently no law in South Carolina requiring the testing of rape kits or dealing with backlog. This a pressing issue because it just leaves victims feeling helpless when law enforcement could be doing more to help them. We propose a law that requires all rape kits to be tested within 30 days of their collection. This would insure that any DNA evidence collected will be run through the criminal database to check to see if any existing information in the database matches that of the evidence collected in the rape kit. <h3>Section</h3> 3: This bill will be funded by a statewide public sales tax increase of 0.5%.

This is not an act to ban gay marriage, it is an act however to protect the rights of religious institutions. Those who have religious beliefs that marriage should be between one man and one woman (Judeo-Christian) or a man and multiple women (Islam) are protected under the 1st amendment from government hindrances on their ability to practice their religion freely. These religions see homosexuality as a sin and should not be faced with the choice of having to violate their moral code to avoid losing their constitutional rights. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  It is a fear of many religious leaders that because of their desire to freely practice religion (which is their right) they will lose their 501c3 status, or even be charged with a hate crime. This act prevents the government or any individual from impeding the free exercise ofreligion; a basic first amendment right. This act does not violate the 14th amendment because it does NOT condone the denial of public service to anyone for any reason. Our act would allow a religious institution to refuse to marry a homosexual couple solely because the moral code of said religion conflicts to homosexuality.

Our bill is going to provide money to put towards the training of resource teachers for the Ortan Gillingham curriculum. The resource teachers will be trained in the Ortan Gillingham curriculum in order to optimize the success of dyslexic students.  All resource teachers must be trained by the beginning of the 2017/2018 school year. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  This bill will be funded through revenue generated by the SC State Education Lottery.  The SC State Board of Education will then require all public school districts to have all resource teachers trained in the Ortan Gillingham curriculum.  This training will be offered regionally throughout the state, free of charge to resource teachers. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  The justifications for this law are as follows:   20-25% of all adults can only read at the lowest level.  This reading level for        adults is because of the lack of education and help they needed in school because of their disability. If this law had been in effect in the past, then we would most likely see more adults reading at a high level.   According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 38% of all fourth grade students are below basic reading skills. They are at or below the 40th percentile for their age group.  With our curriculum this reading level will be much higher.   62% of Dyslexic children dropped out of high school in 2007.  When our bill goes into effect, this percentage will drop dramatically. <h3>Section</h3> 5:      A benefit of this bill would be the progression dyslexia students would make in their education.

MWDs provide the ability of sniffing for bombs, sensing attacks, and most importantly the companionship of soldiers while they are away. These MWDs, on average save about 200 lives and we do not save them as they save us. As we go off to war with these animals bred in the USA we do not bring them home. We do not think about the dogs rights and are not willing to spend money on these dogs that protect us in the line of fire. These dogs are sold off, euthanized or simply abandoned. These dogs are sometimes taken in by the people of these countries and eaten. These American heroes need and deserve more from our people. <h3>Section</h3> 2: We propose to bring these dogs, that we call family, home. These dogs are met and treasured by our military and provide warmth to the ones willing to protect our freedom and our government does not have the resources to bring home these heroes. <h3>Section</h3> 3: An annual budget of $400,000 USD will be allotted towards the evaluation and transportation of these MWDs.  This money will come from the $7.4 billion USD allotted in South Carolina towards the Department of Defense. These dogs will be up for adoption for the 31 percent of veterans living in South Carolina that suffer through post-traumatic stress disorder. The veterans must be screened and deemed responsible before obtaining the MWD. The dogs will be sold for $40 USD to qualified veterans. This revenue will be given to the SC Division of Veterans Affairs. <h3>Section</h3> 4: The justifications for this bill are as follows:   31 percent of veterans living in South Carolina have PTSD.   Studies show that having a dog in the house reduces stress and reduces the symptoms of PTSD.   Dogs provide emotional support to veterans.   Studies show that the veteran and the MWD bond better than a dog that has never experienced the struggle of war. C. Our American heroes are being eaten for food, rather than being treasured as mans best friend. These despicable humans are taking away the rights of beings that give all they have for the place that they call home. <h3>Section</h3> 5: The benefits for this bill are as follows:   Over the next 5 years, over 1000 dogs will be left in the line of fire with nowhere to turn. With this bill signed into law this drastic amount of MWDs will be saved from certain death.   More than 8,030 veterans kill themselves each year in the USA.

In K3, class size would be reduced to 7-8 students. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  Students who come from groups that are traditionally disadvantaged in education will benefit from this bill the most. Students are less likely to be retained, more likely to stay in school and earn better grades. Reducing the class sizes in the early grades reduces the amount of distractions in the room and gives the teacher more time to devote to each child. In early grades, students are just beginning to learn the rules of the classroom. If they have more opportunity to interact with their teacher, they are more apt to feel that they can cope with these changes. Reducing class size is a great way for states and public schools to show that they are improving the quality of education because smaller classes allow teachers to spend more time on instruction and less on classroom management. <h3>Section</h3> 3:  Classes with fewer students will have more one-on-one time with their teacher.

I believe that this practice is outdated and potentially dangerous to other drivers on the road. I propose that every five years, South Carolina Citizens should retake their Drivers Test to insure that they are following all state laws and regulations and are practicing safe driving daily. <h3>Section</h3> 2:  Taking the test every five years would give more money to the state because in order to retake the test you would be charged a testing fee of $12.50. If the state government put a tax on the dmv for the quinquennial testing (government can only tax on the retesting fee), it would give them a little chunk of money and we are always looking for that. The State government could implement a .05% tax rate towards the dmvs $12.50 they make per citizen that has to retest. That would give our government 0.625 cents per person. South Carolina (in 2014) had the population of 4.832 million people and it is still constantly rising.

South Carolina is ranked number eight in the nation for fatalities in wrecks that involve alcohol. 40% of the 767 crash fatalities last year involved an impaired driver in one of the cars. We are ranked number five in the nation in careless driving.  We are ranked number fifteen in the nation for speeding contributing to fatalities in car wrecks. 40% of people that are involved in fatal car wrecks werent wearing seatbelts. In order to cause less laws and regulations from being broken and to stop careless driving from occurring we need to put retesting into effect! Making the retesting a new law, would benefit us all because it would give South Carolina Citizens the knowledge again and help them to remember that laws, regulations, the traffic signs, and all of the things not to do while driving. It would help us to practice safer driving and for us to go up in the rankings as well. It would defiantly cause the fatalities to occur less as well. The retesting would refurbish our brains with the knowledge we need to know to practice safer driving and if you fail the test it looks like you wont be driving till you pass! This would keep safer drivers on the road and not so safe drivers off the road. All of this retesting would cause the statistics I mentioned in the beginning of this <h3>Section</h3> to change.

This would be a really good tradeoff for our government and cause a safer economy for our citizens. <h3>Section</h3> 4: It would be funded by the citizens of South Carolina because they would have to pay to retake the test and then government would receive a tax from the dmvs allowing them to make money off of it. The $12.50 paid from a single citizen to the dmv, would be taxed by our government, and that would give them .0625 per person since they would be taxing 0.05%. Safer driving, less fatal wrecks, and money paid to the dmvs and taxed by the state government, would make a safer and more stable economy. This would be a win win for the state of South Carolina. <h3>Section</h3> 5:  If/when signed into law, the retesting would begin on January 1st, 2016, and would be for anyone who needs to renew their Drivers License and then they would start the cycle of the quinquennial process of retesting to improve safer roads.

Recently, the domestic violence rates in South Carolina have doubled the national average, leaving South Carolina as the state with the highest ratio of domestic violence in the country. A woman is killed by a man every 12 days on average in South Carolina. South Carolina has been ranked in the top 10 of states with the highest domestic violence rates every year since 2000, showing that domestic violence is not just a short term issue. Something must be done to drastically change these statistics and we believe that this bill will greatly contribute to the declining of these ratios by creating more awareness about domestic violence throughout the youth of South Carolina using the public school systems and several different domestic violence help shelters throughout the different counties. This bill would also bring upon tighter regulations and stronger enforcement of the domestic violence laws that are already in place currently. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Under this bill, there will be a large non-profit organization created throughout the public school systems as well as any private or charter schools who wish to incorporate this organization within their school. This volunteer-based program would create a strong partnership between the domestic abuse shelters and the public schools, where weekly assemblies would be held at the school where speakers from these shelters would come to talk to the kids. These speakers could be those who have suffered from abuse and will teach the kids about the severities of domestic violence and what to do if you, or someone you love is suffering through this. This organization would be greatly beneficial by raising more awareness that is needed throughout the state and would protect all of those who have suffered/may suffer with domestic violence in the past or in the future. This bill would also put greater restrictions on the current laws about domestic violence. <h3>Section</h3> 3: There are domestic violence shelters in Greenville, Pickens, Anderson, and Oconee county and the one that is partnered with your school is whatever shelter is closest to it in location.

No US federal laws mandate vaccination, but all 50 states require certain vaccinations for children entering public schools. Most states offer medical and religious exemptions; and some states allow philosophical exemptions. (Procon.org) They believe childrens immune systems can deal with most infections naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a child may cause side effects, including seizures, paralysis, and death. They contend that numerous studies prove that vaccines may trigger problems like autism,ADHD, and diabetes. (ProCon.org) <h3>Section</h3> 2: In the State of South Carolina there are nine vaccines a student must have to admit into a public school. Although these vaccines are valuable for the health and well-being of all, the rapid administration of these vaccines is dangerous and can harm young growing children.  The preservatives and viruses contained in vaccines could cause a reaction and change the childs life forever.  A babys body needs time to develop. By the time the body is two, the body is growing rapidly. The brain is a fragile part of the body and by sending multiple vaccines in a fast pace of time filled with harmful ingredients into a child immune system is just wrong. <h3>Section</h3> 3: The schedule of vaccinating children shouldnt be rushed. The process of putting the vaccines into a childs body should not be standard for all children.  The schedule should be decided on by the pediatrician guided by a childs response the government has no right to determine what and when we put into our children bodies.  By allowing the right for the parents and doctors to determine when the child should receive the vaccines will lower the side effects of vaccines. The intervals for many of these vaccines are a mere two to four weeks. This can be toxic to vibrant growing cells in the bodies of our children. <h3>Section</h3> 4:  By allowing more time for vaccines to take place and to have a choice on the amount of vaccines will lower the amount of side effects in South Carolina.

I believe that this practice is outdated and  potentially dangerous to other drivers on the road. I propose that every five years,   South Carolina Citizens should retake their Drivers Test to insure that they are  following all state laws and regulations and are practicing safe driving daily. <h3>Section</h3> 2: Taking the test every five years would give more money to the state  because in order to retake the test you would be charged a testing fee of $12.50. If  the state government put a tax on the dmv for the quinquennial testing (government  can only tax on the retesting fee), it would give them a little chunk of money and we  are always looking for that. The State government could implement a .05% tax rate  towards the dmvs $12.50 they make per citizen that has to retest. That would give  our government 0.625 cents per person. South Carolina (in 2014) had the population  of 4.832 million people and it is still constantly rising. That tax towards the amount  of people would give our State Government 3,020,000 million dollars every five  years! <h3>Section</h3> 3: South Carolina is rated second to worst by Car Insurance Comparison and  that is a problem I think we need to fix. South Carolina is ranked number eight in the  nation for fatalities in wrecks that involve alcohol. 40% of the 767 crash fatalities last  year involved an impaired driver in one of the cars. We are ranked number five in the  nation in careless driving.  We are ranked number fifteen in the nation for speeding  contributing to fatalities in car wrecks. 40% of people that are involved in fatal car  wrecks werent wearing seatbelts. In order to cause less laws and regulations from  being broken and to stop careless driving from occurring we need to put retesting  into effect! Making the retesting a new law, would benefit us all because it would give  South Carolina Citizens the knowledge again and help them to remember that laws,  regulations, the traffic signs, and all of the things not to do while driving. It would  help us to practice safer driving and for us to go up in the rankings as well. It would  defiantly cause the fatalities to occur less as well. The retesting would refurbish our  brains with the knowledge we need to know to practice safer driving and if you fail  the test it looks like you wont be driving till you pass! This would keep safer drivers  on the road and not so safe drivers off the road. All of this retesting would cause the  statistics I mentioned in the beginning of this <h3>Section</h3> to change. Plus, it would give a  tax to our state government which would be great because hey, who doesnt like  money? This would be a really good tradeoff for our government and cause a safer  economy for our citizens. <h3>Section</h3> 4: It would be funded by the citizens of South Carolina because they would have to pay to retake the test and then government would receive a tax from the  dmvs allowing them to make money off of it. The $12.50 paid from a single citizen  to the dmv, would be taxed by our government, and that would give them .0625 per  person since they would be taxing 0.05%. Safer driving, less fatal wrecks, and money  paid to the dmvs and taxed by the state government, would make a safer and more  stable economy. This would be a win win for the state of South Carolina. <h3>Section</h3> 5: If/when signed into law, the retesting would begin on January 1st, 2016,  and would be for anyone who needs to renew their Drivers License and then they  would start the cycle of the quinquennial process of retesting to improve safer roads.  It would continue on for every one throughout the year and whoever needs to renew  then needs to retake. Then five years later the retesting would take place again.  (license needs to be renewed yearly though).","billTitle":"Drivers Test Again?","division":"House of Representatives","governorEvaluation":"not yet evaluated","id":"-K3KJXaqkFm9WmsqeYT_","rocketDocketStatus":"no","school":"Riverside High School","sponsor":" "},"-K3KJYN2EXHs9tBjEgbM":{"author1":"Inina Walker, Emily Roman,","author2":"Anajae Irby","authorLocation":"not yet assigned","billLocation":"B","billStatus":"on the docket","billText":"<h3>Section</h3>1: Penalties for offenders charged with human trafficking are not strong enough.
