A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Penalize Hate Crimes

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: South Carolina is one of only five states that do not have any laws concerning hate crimes, despite the fact that there were over 50 hate crimes reported in 2013 alone. South Carolina is notorious for its history of prejudice and hate-driven crimes, and according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, there are 19 known hate groups in the state. Increased penalties for hate crimes not only deter smaller crimes such as vandalism or harassment, but according to a study done by the Anti-Defamation League, victims are more likely to report hate crimes if they know there will be a consequence. This bill will create harsher penalties for any misdemeanors or felonies classified as hate crimes. 

Section 2: A hate crime is defined as a crime committed with clear intent to harm a person or property due to their race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, or sexual orientation. If someone is found guilty of a hate crime, they will be subjected to a fine of 2,000 to 10,000 dollars, and/or a prison sentence of two years to life, depending on the severity of the crime. Additionally, all law enforcement agencies will be required to report any and all hate crimes to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). 

Section 3: States with laws such as this in place have not experienced large increases in prison sentences, refuting the argument that such laws would lead to additional costs or prison bloating. Instead, penalties for hate crimes lead to reduced overall crime and higher consequences for “petty” crimes that contribute to racist and damaging ideals. Any additional costs due to extended prison sentences will be covered by fines collected from criminal offenders. 

Section 4: This bill will be enforced by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).

Section 5: Once signed into law, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Require All High School Students to Attend CPR and AED Training 

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer from cardiac arrest while not in a hospital. Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops working due to a malfunction of electrical impulses, which can result in brain damage and death if not treated immediately. In these life-threatening situations, time is everything. A person whose oxygenated blood supply to the brain has been stopped can suffer brain damage within minutes and death in eight to ten minutes. The average first responder response time is eight to twelve minutes and every minute help is delayed a person’s chance of survival decreases by ten percent. 

Section 2: Due to the small window of time, people must be able to react immediately and know the skills necessary to attempt to save a person’s life. CPR, or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, is not only useful in these situations, it is also useful in heart attacks or some near drowning instances, in which a person’s heart has stopped. Additionally, knowledge of how to use an AED, or automated external defibrillator, increases the chances of survival in situations where the victim's heart needs to be returned to a normal rhythm. In combination, these skills can save the life of a person in need.

Section 3:
A. In order to provide as many people as possible with these skills, this bill requires all high school students to take a course on performing CPR and AED usage. The course will be a part of the Physical Education curriculum.                                   
B. Exemptions will be available for students with whose IEP or 504 states that he/she is not able to perform the tasks required in the course. Additionally, a doctor’s note advising of health problems that would cause an inability to perform the tasks required can exempt the student.                                                                                    
C. The district school board shall use an instructional program developed by the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, another nationally recognized program that teaches the most current CPR and AED methods, or a local medical professional, EMS, or other adult certified to teach the most current information by the American Red Cross.     
D. This bill will affect all public high school students, beginning with the class of 2020.

Section 4:  Each school board will be responsible for the funding of their teaching method of choice. As long as the program complies with the guidelines set forth in Section 3, the district may choose whatever program is best for them financially and logistically. 

Section 5: As stated in Section 3, the class will be a mandatory addition to the Physical Education Program. This class is a graduation requirement in South Carolina. Failure to successfully complete this training will result in the withholding of the credit until the student completes the course. The certified instructor will determine if a student passes the training based on the most current standards. Schools will be responsible for the recording of this information.

Section 6: This bill will go into effect August 1, 2016.

Section 2:	The state wide time would increase to 9:00, so the state time would be

Section 4:	The benefits of this bill:
	•	Teenagers need an average of 9 ¼ hours of sleep per night for optimal performance, health and brain development.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Allow New Small Businesses and Their Owners to be Tax Exempt for One Year after Opening

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current tax rates on small businesses in the State of South Carolina range from 5% to 6% and state income taxes on their owners range from 6% to 8%. This is roughly an average of $12,000 in business taxes and $4,300 in income taxes. This bill would allow new small businesses to be exempted from paying any taxes for one year after they open their business in the State of South Carolina, and their owners would be exempted from paying income taxes for one year.

Section 2:	 As stated by the United States Department of Labor, 80% of small businesses fail within the first 18 months. This bill would cut the taxes stated above to 0% for the first year after a business opens, and would exempt the business owner from paying income tax for the first year. According to financial analysts, a proposal like this would save the average small business owner in SC roughly $20,000 in taxes. It also predicts that this would raise the rate of small-businesses in the State of South Carolina by roughly 20%, adding at least $50,000,000 to our state revenue, within the first 3 years of this bill being enacted. This is supported by financial analysts, but also by former projections when South Carolina’s economy grew by 3.4% in two years with a 3% decrease in overall taxes. This bill would allow many people in poorer areas of the state to make their dreams come true and open a small business while focusing on paying their lease or rent and building a client base.

Section 3:	 We will grow the economy by allowing more businesses to stay-open with the money saved from the decrease in taxes. We would also benefit as we would take the top ranking for Business Insider’s best states for small business, which would help grow our population in addition to 4.5% growth we already experience.

Section 4:	 Overall provisions for this bill:
	•	Small businesses would be tax exempt for one year after opening.
	•	Owners would be exempt from income taxes for one year.
	•	After the one year is up, they will pay 50% of the tax rate the second year, and will then return to pay the original taxes the third year.
	•	Small business that pay their workers over $10.00 an hour will be given subsidies in an attempt to raise wages in the state.
	•	The overall revenue gained would go towards infrastructure, education, and a government sponsored organization that helps create small businesses.
Section 5: When signed into law, this new tax policy will go into effect on April 15th, 2016.

An Act to Provide Access to Live Teaching in the Classroom

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, in the state of South Carolina, there is no program available for students to have access to information missed in the classroom.

Section 2:	 When a student is absent from class, important information can be lost amongst the multitude of makeup work received when returning to school. Students also miss information in the class due to distractions and other mishaps. The recording of lessons will allow absent students to have the same teaching as if they were in classroom. Students who are misinformed or confused can access the teachings to provide clarity.

Section 3:	 Every classroom is required to have a live recording of the teaching for that day. The teacher will have a microphone; it will act as a remote that can turn the recording on and off, so that students can listen in on the lesson. The student will be able to watch the presentation using an application that allows a visual of the board with a podcast of the lesson.

Section 4:	 The program will only be accessed by students who have a school-provided student identification and password. The recording of live teaching sessions will allow access for 48 hours, then it is deleted. Students who cannot participate in the live sessions have the option of saving the recordings to be replayed at a later time.  

Section 5: Benefits of letting students have access to live classroom teachings include:
	•	Students won’t fall behind because of illness or distractions. 
	•	Teachers will be more accountable for their lessons and teaching.
	•	Students who are not absent will also gain from the program, and teachers will spend less time trying to get everyone on the same level of learning.
Section 6: When signed into law, the bill will take effect in the 2016-2017 school year.

	•	Stricter adherence to the seat belt laws already in place;
	•	More funding for the DMV, road improvement, and other programs.

Section 5: When signed into law, the first fine increase and age limit will occur on January 1, 2016. The final increase will occur on January 1, 2020.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  	Currently South Carolina is ranked as the 10th most obese state in the 
nation with 32.1% of adults being obese. Obesity is a serious and expensive disease

	•	Bill boards
	•	Newspaper circulars
	•	Mail coupons
	•	Posters

Section 4:	Caloric values must be clearly and legibly indicated.
	•	The caloric value should be of a size that covers 8% of the total area of the advertisement.
	•	The caloric value cannot be obscured by other words or images.

required to cover any costs of calculating caloric count or changing advertisements.

Section 6:	Businesses with current long-term advertisements (i.e. bill boards) will be 
required to change or take down advertisements within six months of the passage of 
this bill.

An Act to Institute Random Drug Tests for Welfare Recipients
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: The current law in South Carolina does not include mandatory random drug testing for welfare recipients.  

Section 2: Mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients would occur for anyone applying for or using welfare. 

Section 3: Drug Testing would be randomized and not announced in advance. To determine who will be selected, there will be a random selection of social security numbers from the South Carolina Department of Social Services. Numbers will be evenly distributed across the state. After welfare recipients are selected, a date will be chosen for recipients to test. DSS employees will be trained in administering the test. If the drug test is skipped or missed without notifying officials, a warrant will be put out for the welfare recipient's arrest. If recipient cannot attend and clears it with the DSS, the date can be rescheduled and made up.

Section 4: This would decrease the number of welfare recipients that use illegal drugs in the state of South Carolina. If test isn’t passed by the welfare recipient, he/she will be placed in a State Sponsored rehabilitation center and will forgo welfare for six month period.
 
Section 5: In order to pay for this drug testing there would be an increase on tobacco taxes by 5 cents. 
 
Section 6: When signed into law, the randomized drug testing will start to take place on January 1, 2016

An Act to Exempt High School Seniors From Attending Class After Final Testing
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: The current state compulsory attendance law requires students in school to attend at least 170 days and are allowed 10 days of lawful, unlawful, or a combination of absences. Excess unexcused absences can lead to the denial of credit for a class.

Section 2: Final exams, whether state or federally given, generally occur two weeks prior to the final date of the school year. By law, students are still required to attend school after exams are over to reach the appropriate amount of seat time necessary. However, after final examination takes place, new material is rarely, if at all, taught. This makes it unnecessary for a 12th grade student who has met all of the requirements for graduation to continue to attend class.
 
Section 3: The bill would exempt all qualifying high school students in South Carolina from attending a class after they have completed and passed the standardized, summative exam for that particular course.

Section 4: A qualifying student is defined as underclassmen who have a 3.8 GPA or higher or a senior who has met the graduation requirements may be exempt from attending class past such final examinations. This would act as an incentive for succeeding students and will help motivate students to maintain a better GPA throughout the school year. 

Section 5: Underclassmen is defined as a high school student enrolled as a student full time in any taxpayer funded high school in South Carolina with enough credit hours to qualify them as a senior.  Students with less than the required credit hours will not qualify.

Section 6: When signed into law, this will take effect in the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Make South Carolina Schools Safer

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, students that attend Public School in South Carolina are allowed to attend school without receiving necessary vaccinations through Medical, Religious, and Special Exemptions. 

Section 2: When passed, this legislation will mandate that all students that are not vaccinated without having the necessary medical exemption will not be allowed to attend public schools. 

Section 3: If parents do not make other arrangements for their child’s education, or do not ensure that their children receive the necessary vaccinations within 30 days, the student will be enrolled in one of South Carolina’s several free virtual schools, up to the parents’ discretion. 

Section 4: If students wish to join any extracurricular athletics or academic activities within their school district, students must have a full physical completed showing that they are cleared and in good health in order to participate. 

Section 5: Students wishing to enter private or parochial school or a private day care have the right to still use the religious exemption, providing that the institution allows them to use it. 

Section 6: Whenever students prove that they have received the necessary vaccinations, which are outlined by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) at the beginning of every school year, students will be immediately allowed to enter public school again. 

Section 7: When enacted, students who are not vaccinated, and do not have the medical exemption will be given 30 days to either receive the necessary vaccinations or be withdrawn for public school. Any students who try to enter South Carolina public schools without medical or special exemptions will not be admitted.

An Act to Mandate Immediate Levels of Punishment on Domestic Violence in Same Sex Relationships

Section 1: The current state law for domestic abuse is not recognized at the same level in same sex relationships.

Section 2:	 The new law would make punishments for domestic violence the same for both heterosexual and same sex relationships.

Section 3: 	Immediate consequences are needed for the following reasons:
	•	Nearly 1 in 4 people have experienced violence by their spouse or partner. 
	•	More than 7 million children have and do live in families in which domestic violence occur. 
	•	Almost 500 women are beaten and sexually assaulted each day in South Carolina and this includes women in same sex relationships
	•	Research indicates that domestic violence among same-sex couples occurs at similar rates as domestic violence among straight couples. Unfortunately, domestic violence victims in same-sex relationships are not receiving the help they need. This is due to the lack of legal recognition of same-sex relationships.
	•	Domestic Violence also involves male victims and those males involved in same sex relationships
Section 4:	 Revenue from this tax would fund:
	•	Education to prevent domestic violence in all relationships
	•	Money would assist with housing recovery of all victims 
	•	Money would be used to create safe houses and educational awareness for all victims
Section 5:	 When signed into law, the first increase will take place on January 1,
2016.

An Act to Limit Regaining of Lost Parental Custody of Children

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, there is no limit on the number of chances a parent has to regain custody of their children after the Department of Social Services has placed them in foster care.

Section 2: Because there is no limit to the number of chances a parent has to regain custody, children in foster care are not being raised in the proper environment.

Section 3: Once a child is removed from his home, parents should be given the opportunity to regain custody after completing a treatment plan. If the child is removed from the home a second time, parental rights will automatically be terminated and the child will be placed into a foster home to be cared for, ensuring that the child grows up in the best possible environment.

Section 4: The termination of parental rights after DSS has taken custody for the second time would:
	•	Prevent kids from moving in and out of foster care throughout their childhood
	•	Decrease the amount of emotional and physical scarring on the child
	•	Ensure that the child grows up in a more stable environment leading to a more successful future. 

Section 5: When signed into law on January 1, 2016, the state will be required to terminate parental rights after the second removal from a home.

An Act to Create the Second Tank Factory in the United States
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Preamble: Whereas the United States currently only has one active tank factory (in Lima, Ohio), this bill will enact the creation of only the second factory in this country.

Section 1: This factory will be built in North Charleston.
	•	The factory will be constructed by the South Carolina government, but operated by a private contractor such as General Dynamics (which currently operates the factory in Ohio). The formation of this single plant would bring over 1,000 jobs to the lowcountry region. 
	•	While the Lima, Ohio Tank factory is currently only equipped to construct M1A1 Main Battle Tanks, the proposed North Charleston Tank Factory (NCTF) would be able to construct other kinds of armored vehicles such as Armored Personnel Carriers and Light Battle Tanks. The NCTF would also be able to upgrade and repair armored vehicles in the US army.
	•	The construction of this plant would double the United States Military’s tank production capability, bring over 1,000 jobs at the region, and put South Carolina at the forefront of the war against the enemies of the United States of America.

Section 2: Currently, the city of North Charleston is the largest city with the highest unemployment rate in the state. It is the third most populous city in the state as well. This bill would provide economic growth to the region, along with a contribution to the power of the United States military directly from the people of South Carolina.

Section 3: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this bill will go into effect on March 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Legalize Male and Female Prostitution Within a Commercial Organization

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Prostitution will be legalized under the following rules and regulations.

Section 2: This law would allow any male or female to apply for a license to become a legal prostitute within the confines of South Carolina.

Section 3: In order for the male or female to receive a license to work under a registered brothel, he or she must prove medically that they have no Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI). The applicant must pass a mandatory drug test. They must meet a legal age limit of 18 years. Persons that sign up for a license permit themselves to undergo mandatory STI tests on a weekly basis. Condoms are required to be worn by all male prostitutes and customers. A recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health reveals that of the combined 3,290 clients of forty different legal sex workers, not one received penetrative sex without a condom. This information contrasts greatly with the realities of street prostitution. Women working without the protection of brothel management are often intimidated or forced to perform these same services without the benefit of safeguards for their health. Persons that believe that they have contracted an STI from a prostitute may press charges if they provide sufficient evidence that they received the STI while obtaining the services from the brothel in question, and vice-versa. Prostitutes may only work within the confines of brothel in which they are employed. If any rules and regulations are not followed, licenses will be suspended until all rules and regulations are met. If standards are not met within a certain period of time, licenses will be revoked.

Section 4: Businesses must be licensed in order to become a brothel. To acquire a license, a business must pay a licensing fee. The license will only allow for a certain amount of prostitutes to be employed at any one time. The price of the license will rise incrementally as the amount of prostitutes employed rises. Brothels are subjected to random checks from the Health Department annually.

Section 5: The commercial licensing fee would be 100,000 dollars annually. For every additional 15 prostitutes employed, and extra 50,000 dollars will be added annually. All profits are subjected to state, city, and federal income tax. Businesses may decide rate for services and payment of employees.

Section 6: This would allow for:
	•	The brothel to safely and legally obtain money for sexual intercourse/oral sex.
	•	People to safely and legally purchase sexual intercourse/oral sex.
	•	The freeing up of space in state/county prisons.
	•	Large amounts of money raised for state projects.
	•	large decrease in street solicitation for prostitutes.
	•	Influx of money within the state.
	•	Decrease in drug usage among prostitutes.
	•	large decrease in human trafficking rates.
	•	Decrease in illegal solicitation of prostitutes on streets.
	•	Decrease in Sexually Transmitted Infections.
	•	Decrease in the amount of money spent prosecuting women and men.
	•	Increased safety for women currently working on streets.
Section 7: When signed into law the bill will be enacted on January 1st, 2016.

An Act to Prohibit Sagging Pants

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

unnecessarily lower than what is widely regarded and accepted as the normal

An Act to Eliminate Polystyrene Trays

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, schools across the state are spending unnecessary amounts of time and money to dispose of toxic polystyrene trays, which is a problem that could be easily solved by switching to decomposable trays.

Section 2: Styrene, a major chemical component of polystyrene tray, is a toxic pollutant and leads to:
	•	Creates hazardous working conditions and waste,
	•	Found to leach into the food that is put in trays, which is then served to the students,
	•	And could possibly be scraped off and eaten by students who scrape the tray while eating.
Section 3: The shift to decomposable trays will be done by school districts, starting in the Upstate and working its way south and toward the East Coast, in a 6-month time period.

Section 4: For this shift to take place, there would not have to be an additional tax, because instead of using the money already in the budget to buy polystyrene trays, the money will now be allocated for the purchasing of decomposable trays.

Section 5: Since there will now be money left over from buying the cheaper decomposable trays, the tax money can now be used to fund:
	•	The hiring of new teachers,
	•	The improvement of school lunches to healthier choices,
	•	And the purchasing of new materials for the classrooms and for the students.
Section 6: When signed into law, the first shift to disposable trays will take place December 15, 2015.

An Act to Require a Boating License for All Ages

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, in the state of South Carolina, anyone over the age of 16 can operate a boat with no license or restrictions. Anyone under this age can operate a boat alone, that is powered by less than 15 horsepower, or over 15 horsepower in the presence of someone 18 years or older. They must also have passed a boating safety course approved by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.

Section 2: The required age for operating a boat would be changed to age 12 and older, as long as that person has passed a boating safety course and has a boating license.

Section 3: Because anyone at and above the age of 16 needs a license to legally operate a car, operating a boat should also be regulated at all ages through a license. After the age of 12, a person can take a course given by the Department of Natural Resources that, if passed, will grant them a boaters license that will let them operate a boat alone. This license will have to be renewed every 10 years. 

Section 4: Changing this age would:
	•	The number of boating deaths in SC in 2014 was between 1 and 2.9 fatalities per 100,000 registered boats. South Carolina was fourth in the nation for boating deaths in 2013. This change of a mandatory license would increase the safety in the water.
	•	Prevent young children from having the right to operate a boat when they do not even know the responsibilities.
	•	Make people pay for license just like they have to for driving. This would go to the state helping with the coast guard and marinas.
Section 5: When signed into law, the first changes will take place on January 1st 2016.

An Act to provide free Pre-Kindergarten in the state of South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current free pre-k program “Head Start” would be replaced by a free public Pre-k program available to all schools in South Carolina. 

Section 2: The South Carolina Educational Lottery would now fund a public pre-k program instead of the HOPE scholarship. The scholarship spends approximately 136,000,000 a year which would cover public pre-k in all South Carolina schools. 

Section 3: Due to the tendency of children’s brains and attitudes to form in the first five years of their life, an additional free year of learning is critical for proper and “on-track” education. Children with this extra year of preparation will have a better transition into kindergarten leading to a better chance of success. This opportunity would also defy several social barriers for each child involved by giving them the opportunity to interact directly with other children prior to entering grade school. All of these factors would attribute to a higher passing rate and lower dropout rate within schools. As well as a higher graduation rate, students would be finishing high school with higher GPA’s and test scores. This would qualify them for the LIFE scholarship with more money being granted than the HOPE. 

Section 4: Revenue from the Educational Lottery would fund:
	•	Teacher pay and benefits;
	•	Added classrooms if necessary;
	•	Classroom supplies. 
Section 5: When signed into law, the first year of public Pre-K will begin August 16, 2016.

An Act to Change From Rags to Disposable Wipes

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, waiters and waitresses that are tasked with cleaning tables must use a rag to clean up the waste, and many do not replace their rags for hours on end, resulting in a dirty and unsanitary restaurant and dining experience.

Section 2: Instead of using these dirty rags to clean up a mess, waiter and waitresses will be required to use disposable a clean, new disposable wipe for every table to keep the restaurant sanitary for the guests. The funding for the purchase of the disposable wipes would be 2 cents added to the tax tacked on to the final bill at a restaurant.

Section 3: The changing of these rules would affect:
	•	The health and safety of customers and employees.
	•	The environment for dining.
	•	The hygiene of a restaurant.
Section 4: When signed into law, the first increase will take place January 1, 2016.

An Act to Regulate Parasailing

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Currently there are no state wide regulations for parasailing companies in South Carolina.

Section 2: A statewide parasailing regulation would be implemented to prevent parasailing when wind speeds are over 18 miles per hour or when wave height is greater than 5 feet.  This policy will help prevent parasailing related injuries and improve the safety of the activity.  

Section 3: Each parasailing operator would be required to retain a weather log detailing the date, time, wind speed, and wave height for every outing.  Weather logs will be provided by and submitted to the Coast Guard every three months.  

Section 4: Coast Guard boats would continue to monitor waters to ensure that no one is parasailing in unsafe weather conditions.

Section 5: For violators of this act, punishments are as indicated below:
	•	For operations that fail to submit weather log: 
	•	1st offense: A fine of $200 will be imposed on the operator.
	•	2nd offense and beyond: A fine of $200 will be imposed on the operator along with a 3 month suspension from operation.
	•	For operations that run during unsafe weather conditions:

An Act to Reduce the Amount of Regular School Days in a Week

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state regulated school week consisting of five days (public schools) would be reduced to four, eliminating all Fridays from each school week.
        	
Section 2: The state regulated school week will be reduced by one day to four days a week.  The total amount of school days would be reduced to 148 days of school.

Section 4:  The reduction of the state regulated school week would:
	•	Limit the amount of money spent on school lunches prepared for Fridays;
	•	Reduce the amount of money spent on heating and air conditioning used on Fridays;
	•	Cut the cost of transportation to school used on Fridays.
Section 5:  When signed into law, this bill will take effect on July 1, 2016.

An Act to Introduce an Education Buy Out Program
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 Section 1: We all know that modern education as it exists today is an impractical and inefficient use of a student’s time. Many studies have been performed that show that modern education in not effective in preparing our children for their future. 

Section 2: This bill proposes a bypass to the inefficiency by allowing those equipped with life’s most essential resource (money) to basically buy their diploma without having to waste life’s second most essential resource (time). Since money and time are paramount for success, why not use one to gain more of the other? Many upper class South Carolinians that already have the means to succeed in life are forced to attend school and graduate in order to fulfill social norms. This bill eliminates that dreadful situation, all the while reducing the average amount of students per class, allowing for more one on one teacher/ student interactions. 

Section 3: Pricing would be set as follows: $100 for elementary school, $500 for middle school, $1,000 for a high school diploma, $100,000 for a Bachelor’s degree, $200,000 for a Master’s degree, or $500,000 for a PhD. The funds collected through this process would dramatically increase state revenue, and the profits would be allocated to bettering SC infrastructure, as well as to public institutions of higher learning.
 
Section 4: If signed into law, this bill will become effective upon the start of the 2016-2017 school year.

Death with Dignity Act: An act to legalize physician assisted dying

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Physician assisted death indicates the ability of a medical doctor to knowingly and intentionally provide a person with the knowledge or means required to initiate death.  This can include counselling about lethal doses of drugs, prescribing such lethal doses, or supplying the drugs necessary for death.  Physician assisted suicide and euthanasia are grouped under the umbrella of physician assisted dying.  PAS is at the request and consent of the patient, where the patient will self-administer the means of death.  In euthanasia, the doctor will administer the means of death.       
          
Section 2: To request a prescription for lethal medications, the Death with Dignity Act requires that a patient voluntarily express his wish to die and be:
	•	an adult,
	•	a South Carolina resident,
	•	mentally capable, and
	•	diagnosed with a terminal illness (incurable and irreversible) that will lead to death within twelve months.

 Section 3: Patients meeting these requirements are eligible to request a prescription for lethal medication from a licensed Oregon physician. To receive a prescription for lethal medication, the following steps must be fulfilled:
	•	the patient must make two oral requests to his physician, separated by at least 15 days;
	•	the patient must provide a written, witnessed request to his physician (two witnesses);
	•	the prescribing physician and a consulting physician must confirm the diagnosis and prognosis;
	•	the prescribing physician and a consulting physician must determine whether the patient is capable;
	•	if either physician believes the patient's judgment is impaired by a psychiatric or psychological disorder, he must refer the patient for a psychological examination;
	•	the prescribing physician must inform the patient of feasible alternatives to assisted suicide, including comfort care, hospice care, and pain control; and
	•	the prescribing physician must request, but may not require, the patient to notify his next-of-kin of the prescription request.

 Section 4: An adult in the state of South Carolina will be referred to as anyone who is 18 years or older.

Section 5:  "Capable" means that in the opinion of a court or in the opinion of the patient's attending physician or consulting physician, psychiatrist or psychologist, a patient has the ability to make and communicate health care decisions to health care providers, including communication through persons familiar with the patient's manner of communicating if those persons are available.   

 Section 6:  Physicians and patients who follow the act's requirements are protected from criminal prosecution, and the choice of legal physician-assisted suicide cannot affect the status of a patient's health or life insurance policy.

 Section 7:  All laws or parts of laws in conflict with this bill are herewith repealed to the extent of the conflict.

 Section 8: If any portion of this act shall be declared unconstitutional, it is the intent of the Legislature that the other portions shall remain in full force and effect.

 Section 9: This bill will be implemented January 1, 2016

An Act to Change the Nomination and Election of South Carolina Judges

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in the state of South Carolina, the sixty judges that constitute the state Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Circuit Courts all are elected by the General Assembly, the state House of Representatives and the Senate. This is done through recommendation by the South Carolina Judicial Merit Selection Committee. In fact, other than Virginia, South Carolina is the only state to appoint judges based solely on legislative election, putting too much power in the legislature. Furthermore, of the 170 current members of the General Assembly, fifty, or around thirty percent, are active attorneys and thus argue cases in front of the justices that they chose to elect. This creates a political climate in which justices can become biased and thus make rulings not by evidence presented but by whichever legislator is arguing the case so that they will be reelected at the expiration of their term.

Section 2: This bill will change the election of justices instead to slightly mirror the federal system to resolve the potential bias and imbalance within the current system. Thus, justices will be nominated by the acting Governor and subsequently approved by the South Carolina Judicial Merit Selection Committee. Then, the Governor's nomination will be confirmed by a simple majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 

Section 3: Also, because this is simply a reform measure within the government to alleviate a corruption issue, there would be no need for funding or expenditure from the government. The reason we decided upon a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly is simply because a two-thirds majority is difficult to attain, which would still lead to justices having to appease legislators to get elected. With a simple majority, a consensus is more easily reached, alleviating justices with the pressure to appease certain legislators. Also, if the General Assembly rejects a judicial candidate, then that candidate is taken off of the ballot for the position since the Governor has no veto power in South Carolina, except for bills concerning budget. Thus, the legislature's decision is final.

Section 4: As this bill is meant to curb judicial corruption, the bias and dependency of justices regarding specific legislators should decrease. However, the South Carolina Commission on Judicial Conduct is still responsible to seek out bias amongst justices, as it was designed to do, and administer punishment and trial as necessary. 

Section 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.

An Act to Mandate CPR Chest Compression, AED training, and Choking Training as a Requirement for Graduation.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: Currently 395,000 people have cardiac arrests outside of hospitals yearly and only 6% survive. This rate is unacceptably low and needs to be increased to lessen the number of heart-broken families.

Section 2: This is a bill to mandate training in the Heimlich maneuver, AED usage and CPR chest compressions in order graduate from high school.

Section 3: The Heimlich Maneuver is a technique used to dislodge foreign contaminants from the airway when an obstruction of breathing is caused. It helps the victim dislodge the foreign contaminant with little to no risk for the first responder. The CPR chest compression is part of the full CPR process. This is a technique used to help the victim’s heart continue pumping blood through their body in event of cardiac arrest or may possibly even restart the heart on its own. This technique in the CPR process also poses little to no risk to the first responder.
An AED gives an automated electric discharge in to help restart the victim's heart.

Section 4: Students can be licensed in these techniques through use of a DVD purchased through the American Heart Association for $67, including the training booklets. The only other necessary pieces of equipment, mannequins and a practice AED, can be borrowed from other organizations if funds are unavailable.

Section 5: Necessary funds can come from the revenue of athletic events.

Section 6: Students that are licensed through another program do not have to use the school program as long as they provide proof of passing the course and their certification is still valid for 1 year after they graduate.

Section 7: Students and teachers that are certified in the eight hour American Heart Association CPR training may work as skills assessors for the “Friends and Family” American Heart Association training.  Lead trainers for the watch and learn program could include, school nurses, physical education instructors, and certified teachers.

Section 8: Students would be required to take this program in their Junior year of Senior year to graduate. Students that take the program prior to these years would receive service hours if required for an organization or their school graduation.

Section 9: This bill will be enacted at the start of the 2016 school year in order to give schools time to make necessary arrangements.

An Act to Appropriate Funds for Deep Web Crime Prevention

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Appropriation of 5% of South Carolina’s SLED funding dedicated solely to the tracking and preventing of crimes via deep web activities.  (Human/drug trafficking, arms trading, etc.)

Section 2: This bill would be implemented at the beginning of the next state fiscal cycle when the state legislature approves a new budget making sure that 5% of SLED’s cyber budget is dedicated to deep web crime prevention.  Also, this bill would not cost any more money to the taxpayers as all this bill does is reapropriate funds.

Section 3: On deep web servers, online activity is impossible to track therefore making this corner of the internet a safe haven for criminals.  Sites like Silk Road use virtual currency called Bitcoin to pay for often illegal services such as drug smuggling, human trafficking, contract killings, and illegal arms dealing.  In the state of South Carolina, it’s been estimated by SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) that while only 20% of all drugs are shipped via deep web transactions, they account for 43% of all drug trafficking profits.  Because the deep web is such a safe effective place to sell illegal products, criminals are flocking to it in droves.

Section 4: If implemented, this bill would:
	•	decrease drug crime via undercover online investigations
	•	reduce presence of online drug rings such as Silk Road in the state of South Carolina

An Act to Create a Safe Environment for the Discussion of Domestic and Sexual Abuse

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  	Currently in the state of SC, when a student in public schools enters 5th grade, they attend a seminar of the development of their body. Over the rest of the time that they are in high school, they progressively learn more about sexual education. However, there is no program that teaches awareness of domestic and sexual abuse.  

Section 2: Our bill would introduce a program that teaches the youth in public schools about domestic and sexual abuse. The program starts in fifth grade and is taught in conjunction with the curriculum of fifth grade level sex education. As the details of sex education increase, so will details on domestic and sexual education.  For example, at fifth grade level, body awareness and creating a safe environment for communicating concerns at home.  

Section 3: Sexual Education is a program that is taught through the Physical education and Health classes in public schools.  The teachers of this sexual education curriculum would teach the Domestic and Sexual Abuse curriculum as well, therefore, no additional faculty would need to be hired. State Educational Budget would fund the development of the curriculum, and a revisal update every 7 years.

Section 4: Once the curriculum is developed and approved by the Superintendent of Education, this program would go into affect the beginning of the following school year.

An Act to Require High School Students to Take a Semester of Family and Consumer Science
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: Our bill is put in place to encourage South Carolina’s youth to have knowledge on common household practices. Meals: how to cook a nutritional, reasonably priced meal as opposed to spending money on unhealthy fast food; Cleaning: how to maintain a household and change sheets, wash dishes, wash clothes, change diapers, etc.; everyday knowledge: change tires, balance checkbook, pay taxes, jump a car, handle children, CPR, etc.
 
Section 2:  Along with being required to take courses such as Physical Education, teens in America should be required to complete at least one semester of Home Economics for basic knowledge on cooking, cleaning, and other daily needs that is vital to life. 
 
Section 3:  South Carolina graduation requirements state that every high school student needs 7.0 elective credits to graduate. This course would only take up .5 of those electives and could technically be optional due to the fact that it would be considered an elective and most schools have a wide variety of them to chose from. This would at least give students an opportunity to attain these basic skills that our bill is advocating. Some kids have parents who work late shifts and do not get home in time to cook dinner. With this course they would know how to make a healthy meal that is a good price. Also, when kids go to college they would now have the knowledge of nutritional values of different food so they could make healthier decisions on their diets. This course would also provide young South Carolinians with the knowledge of changing tires, cleaning.

Solar Energy to Power Government Buildings
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
Section 1: Of the multiple ways that the US get its energy, one of the most cost effective and safest has definitely got to be the harnessing of solar energy. If we used solar energy in all of our endeavors in government, it would benefit many across the country. The first and most obvious one has got to be the benefits on the environment.

Section 2: After this exchange occurs, the US Government will have not actually spent any money. Instead they would have made money.
Section 3: This will help to save the US government money as well as benefit the environment. It could also help to jump start major independent corporations to take the same approach. 
Section 4: The solar panels will be covered by pre-existing budget because that money used to supply government buildings with energy will buy the solar panels. The US government will come out of the transaction with money left over.
Section 5: The mandatory solar panel usage will come into effect January 19, 2016.

An Act to Create Eco-Friendly Energy

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Our current energy sources are pollutive, nonrenewable, and expensive. Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, etc. harm our atmosphere, of which we breath and protect us from excess solar radiation. The current property tax for corporations and businesses is currently 10.5%, but when companies use eco-friendly alternative energy sources the tax will be reduced to 8.5%. The 2% will be accounted for by increasing the tobacco sales tax.

Section 2:	 The tobacco sales tax will be adjusted to meet the differences thus when the alternative energy companies relocate to South Carolina within a month of residency, the property tax will be decreased to 8.5%.

Section 3:	 Companies would have to meet the qualifications of “alternative energy” to be allowed the tax break. Members of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environment Control will decided which companies are qualified to receive the tax break.

Section 4:	 Qualifications for the tax breaks are as follows.
	•	Must be eco-friendly, not harming the environment. 
	•	Renewable energy source
	•	Cheaper source of energy to manufacture (hydropower, wind power, solar power).

Section 5: Revenue from this will be slow, but an investment into the future of a cleaner, healthier South Carolina. With an increase of sales taxes on tobacco, there may be a decrease in sales and fewer fumes in the air. 

Section 6: When signed into law, the tax break will take place on January 1, 2016.

Section 4:	 This law would improve student’s ability to complete class projects, essays, and better understanding of computers and how to type.

Section 5: The law would require students in fourth and fifth grade to begin taking keyboarding classes, to improve their typing abilities.
