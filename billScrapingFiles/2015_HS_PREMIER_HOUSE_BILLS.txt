Smoking and Crashing: An act to outlaw smoking while driving

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGLISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The average of measured driving distraction of smokers is about 12 seconds. It covers a distance of 525 feet with a speed of 30/mph without looking at the road. Using a phone has a distraction duration of 10.6 seconds, which covers a distance of 492 feet in 30/mph. This result suggests that cigarette smoking produces a remarkable risk for road safety, more than phone use.

Section 2: The act of smoking is a visual distraction because drivers search around their car for the cigarettes and the lighter. Smoking while driving is also a cognitive distraction because the driver’s brain is focused on finding and then lighting the cigarette. It is also a manual distraction because drivers are required to use both hands to light the cigarette and once it is lit, the driver will keep one hand on and off the wheel. 

Section 3: The smoke in the car can cause a shortage of oxygen, which can cause light headed or dizziness, which can lead to the driver becoming even more distracted.

Section 4: Throwing a cigarette outside, while the vehicle is moving, is the prevalent reason of setting fire to the edge of the road. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the first outlaw will take place on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Outlaw Semi-trucks from Driving in the Fast Lane

BE IT HERBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: Over 88% of all goods are transported by semi-trucks, traveling on average 178 miles from the factory to warehouse, warehouse to store. Semi-trucks cannot increase their speed at the rate as most cars; therefore, there is no need for them to be in the fast lane. Also, they have larger blind spots than cars; therefore, it makes it much more dangerous to switch lanes. These trucks share the road with people and their families.

Section 2: When a semi is involved in an accident, it is three times more likely to be fatal. Nearly 80% of those killed in a wreck involving a semi, are the people in the other vehicle. If semi-trucks were not allowed to drive in the fast lane, then it would help to decrease the number of wrecks involving semi-trucks each year. 

Section 3: The penalty for the truck driver would be a ticket of 150 dollars. The money from the tickets could go towards other much needed projects which would ultimately benefit our state.

Section 4: The results of enacting this bill would be:
	•	The number of wrecks caused by semi-trucks would decrease 
	•	The highways would be safer 

Section 5: When signed into a law, the first outlaw will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Mandate a Monthly K-9 Drug Search in High Schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: South Carolina high schools will be subject to a random monthly K-9 unit drug search.

Section 2: If the K-9 unit drug search would go to high schools at random times once a month, the percent of minors using drugs would decrease significantly over a 3 year period. Thus, by September, 2019, the percentage of high school students using drugs in South Carolina can be projected to drop significantly from its current standard of 44%.

Section 3: Immediate funds would come from a 1% increase on property taxes. The money to support this bill would come from taxes because it would create government jobs. The funds would be used to maintain the K-9 units and keep them functioning at full capacity. 

Section 4: The result of enacting this bill will be:
	•	The amount of minors using drugs would decrease.
	•	The amount of high schoolers graduating would also increase due to a decrease in drug related expulsions and drop-outs.
 Section 5: When signed into law, the first inspection shall take place in September, 2016.

An Act to Require Teachers to be CPR Certified

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently there is no law regarding teachers being CPR certified this would be changed to have all teachers be CPR certified as part of certification or recertification.

Section 2: Before a teacher is hired they must complete a course on first aid and CPR or must show proof that they have previously completed the course and is still valid. The instructor, if possible, must confirm that they have completed and passed the course.

Section 3: Because some teachers transfer, they would be required to take the course prior to being hired.

Section 4: The pros of this would be:
	•	Being able to provide a safer environment for students and other faculty members
	•	It would create a larger skill set for teachers
	•	Allow emergency situations to run smoothly, there would be less panic if the teacher knew how to handle the situation.

Section 5: When signed into law, the first increase will take place on January 1, 2015.

Section 1: According the current Common Core initiative, students in high school must take a minimum of 4 english classes, 4 math classes, 3 science classes, 3 social studies classes, and at least 7 electives to graduate.

Section 3: Non-honors students will be given a chance to take the course, but they will have to take a 2-week proficiency summer class to show that they can handle and understand the course load that the curriculums will require.

Section 4: The purpose of this bill is to allow the gifted few in our schools to excel and go beyond the normal high school diploma, this bill will teach and shape the leaders and geniuses of the next generation. It will bring the brightest out of the hard working students who want to excel and want to make a change in the world and their community.

Section 5: When signed into law, it will go into effect at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year across the state.

An Act to Increase the Amount of Women’s Shelters 

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1:	This bill will seek to increase the amount of current women’s shelters throughout the state. The current amount of shelters, 26, would be increased by 1 shelter every 5 years. 	

Section 2:	South Carolina is the second highest ranking state in domestic violence. This bill would possibly decrease this ranking by providing shelter for women and children in unsafe situations. 

Section 3:	For each city or town with a population over 10,000 a new shelter would be built every five years. There are 13 cities or towns with a population over 10,000. Within 10 years the amount of shelters would be 52 throughout the state. Although a place may be considered a city, if it doesn’t have a population of over 10,000 it will not qualify for this bill. 

Section 4:	Annually, it would cost around $157,650 to keep a women’s shelter running. It would cost about $4,098,900 a year for all 13 cities or towns to build and run the additional 26 shelters. This money would come from fundraisers and slight tax increase. 

Section 5:	The effective date of this bill would be January 1, 2018.

A bill to eliminate income tax for retirees

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill will eliminate income tax for retirees that are no longer working. Currently there is a 7% income tax for all people, including people no longer earning income. This bill would not apply to retirees that choose to work a second jobs or part-time jobs.  This bill would only apply to retirees that do not have additional income from work.  

Section 2: It will grant us the benefit of attracting many wealthy retirees to move South Carolina and spend money on things such as homes and shopping. Florida and Tennessee both have no income tax for anyone, Alabama has implemented a bill very similar to this, and soon Georgia will have the same bill as Alabama implemented by the end of 2016. This already makes these states more appealing to retirees.

Section 3: For a retiree to qualify for not paying their income tax they must:
	•	Be over the age of 65
	•	Not earning an income
	•	Have some sort of retirement fund.  Examples include:  401k, Roth IRA, mutual funds, state or federal pension.  

Section 4: This bill will be enforced by the Department of Revenue in South Carolina.

Section 5: This would require increasing the tax on tobacco from $0.57 to $0.65 and alcohol (spirits per gallon) from $5.42 to $5.65.

Section 6: When signed into law, the elimination of income tax for retirees will take place on January 1st, 2016.

An Act to Save Student Athletes’ Concentration

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Rationale - Student athletes are constantly struggling to keep their grades up and get their homework done, especially on game days. Our bill seeks to give student athletes an extra day to finish their homework.  

Section 2: Stipulations - Any athlete that plays for their school will have an extra day to get their homework finished on game days with a signed letter from the coach.  This does not exempt any student from their homework. Test are not excused. 

Section 3:  Definitions
	•	Athlete:  Any individual that is on the official roster of the school’s sports team, band, or competition based clubs. 
	•	Homework:  Assignment given that would be required to occur outside of the regular school day
	•	Coach:  Officially designated person in charge of sports team, band, or club competition
	•	Day:  24 Hours from the time of assignment is posted, assigned, or disseminated

Section 4:  Exemptions - This bill would not apply to club or private teams outside of the school’s jurisdiction.  

Section 5: Exemptions - Fridays have exemption due to the two extra days on the weekend. Tournaments that last all weekend would count as a game but only if the athlete plays for a school and has a signed letter from the coach stating that the athlete got home after 7pm on Sunday and left before 7pm on Friday, anything less than that would give the athlete enough time to complete the assignment(s). 

Section 6: Enforcement - All public taxpayers funded school districts will be required to put in place the new homework policy immediately upon passage of this bill into law.  School district officials will be in charge of dissemination the information regarding the new home work policy.

An Act to Change the Teacher Evaluation System

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current teacher evaluation system, EVAAS, will be eliminated and replaced with systems that individual district committees create. This would give teachers more voice and include them as stakeholders in the evaluation process that dictates the success in their careers.

Section 2: Every district in the state would assemble a committee of teachers comprised from their respective districts.  Every public elementary, middle, and high school in the district would nominate one teacher to represent their school. The committee would also include the district’s testing coordinator appointed by the district. This committee will be nominated during the Fall of 2016 by their fellow teachers and compiled by the administration.  

Section 3: Compensation will be allocated to teachers that participate in the committee to cover costs of their time in service. The compensation will be defined by the teacher’s hourly wage.

Section 4: The committees would meet over the course of the 2016-2017 school year to create their system. The new system would have to be finalized by June 1, 2017. The newly decided evaluation system would then be implemented by the 2017-2018 school year. If the deadline is not met, the districts will be required to continue to EVAAS system until of the finalization of a new system.

Section 5: During the first week before the school year, the representatives sent to the meeting will teach the program to their respective schools. The program will require for teachers to attend two workshops, one in the fall and one in the spring, in order to be officially trained.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: As of 2010, the United States, population of people, male and female, over the age of eighteen was recorded at 265,263,257. That would roughly increase to nearly 503,148,882 people, which are all legal to vote by the year 2020. 

Section 2: Thus, there should be some modifications made to our voting requirements. Many voters do not now what they are standing for- voting tests should be applied. When voting someone into office, you need to trust him or her. If you do not know what the candidates stand for, you cannot fully trust them.

Section 3: Voting tests would allow you to apply real life situations to a candidate’s belief on that situation. Therefore, giving you an idea on who you agree with the most in the election. 

Section 4: Revenue from this act would be:
	•	This would ensure that people would be voting for what they believe in instead of voting without knowledge.
	•	It would ensure accuracy and minimize complaints among voters.
	•	Voting would require more knowledge of the candidate and require more responsibility for the voters to vote because they would have to think about what each candidate stands for and not because of other people’s opinions. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the first test will take place on November 8th, 2016

An Act to Mandate that each Port Implant Proper Medical Screening Procedures

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently the SC Port Authority is not equipped to properly screen and examine international workers for communicable diseases. Proper medical screening procedures would benefit the well-being of the citizens of South Carolina. 

Section 2: The screening procedures would ensure life threatening infectious diseases are not communicated to South Carolinian citizens. After completing the screening process, tamper-proof credentials will be presented to those who pass. 

Section 3: If an individual does not pass the screening process, they will not be allowed access to the port. 

Section 4: The state would not be responsible for any funding. It would be allocated through the Port Authority’s annual budget.

Section 5: This screening process would:
	•	Decrease the probability of spreading these communicable diseases;
	•	Assure the citizens of South Carolina that the international workers are healthy and safe;
	•	Keep state-wide security in line with nation-wide port security. 

Section 6: When signed into law, this bill will become effective January 1st, 2016.

An Act to include a sustainability program in our science curriculums

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Schools are major consumers of energy, paper, food, water, cleaning products, and other resources.  They generate waste, pollution, and greenhouse gases.  Schools have the potential to serve as models of sustainability through their ability to teach students and those in relation to them.	

Section 2:  Schools will include a sustainability program in their science curriculum with teachers in role of the advisor.  Implementing this program into our curriculum would encourage students to appreciate the environmental factors around them and encourage creativity in the classes.
 
Section 3:  Science teachers would begin teaching a curriculum on how we should preserve our environment and the creative ways we could do it. Kids would in turn learn how to preserve our environment for our generation and those after us.

Section 4:  Results of this act would be as follows:
	•	Students would have a better understanding of our environment
	•	There would be a greater appreciation for the Earth
	•	Students would learn creative ways to preserve our resources          
	•	Cost savings to the school district through reduction of waste.               

Section 5: When signed into law, the curriculum would take effect in the new school year of 2016 and 2017.

An Act to Create an Education Tax

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current funding of school systems is not sufficient enough to provide all of the supplies necessary for an excellent education.  Only 5% of taxes from South Carolinians go towards education.

Section 2: There will be a new tax created solely for the purpose of funding education.  This tax will be 1% of a person’s gross income, and it will be collected per person, annually.

Section 3: This tax would negatively affect persons below the poverty line and those included in the dependency ratio.  So, only those who receive $90,000 a year in income will be required to pay the tax.	

Section 4: Revenue created from the education tax would fund:
	•	Textbooks and workbooks for at least the high school level;
	•	Clubs and organizations to keep students involved in school activities;
	•	Computers and other forms of technology to enhance the learning environment.	

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Increase High School Lunch Time

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state high school lunch time of an average 25 minutes would be lengthened to 35 minutes, an increase of 10 minutes during the lunch period.

Section 2: The state’s high school classes would have 1.5 minutes deducted from each period or 2.5 from each block, depending on how the school is set up. With this small amount of time taken off each period or block, the lunch time would increase at least 10 minutes.

Section 3: Although some schools already require this time length, we believe that all schools should meet this standard of 35 minutes. This standard should not be a hard to meet as seen in Section 2.

Section 4: Time from this act would allow:
	•	child obesity rates in South Carolina to decrease
	•	the average student buying lunch also time to eat it 
	•	student’s brains comprehend what and how much they are eating
	•	students have a stress free lunch period

Section 5: When signed into law, the increased lunch period schedule will take effect during the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Require a Boaters License For all Boaters

Section 1: In South Carolina, only people under the age of 16 are required to have a boater’s license. Our bill will require all boaters to have a boater’s license.
 
Section 2:  Over 2,503 boating accidents were reported last year, resulting in approximately 200 deaths. This bill, if signed into law would reduce the number of accidents and fatalities dramatically.

Section 4: Those born before the date of January 1, 1999 that do not have a boating license at the time of the signing of the bill, will not be required to obtain a license. License renewal will be treated just as driver’s license renewal is and will be done so by the Department of Natural Resources.

An Act to Increase the High School Dropout Age to 18

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently the high school dropout age for South Carolina is 17 years old; we believe that this age should be increased to 18 years old. 
  	
Section 2:	Only 61.7 percent of high school students in South Carolina graduate on time. By raising the dropout age to 18, students will be more likely to complete their high school education. High school dropouts earn $9,200 less per year on average than those students who graduate. Over the course of their lifetime they will earn $375,000 less than high school graduates and around $1 million less than college graduates. High school dropouts are 3 times more likely to be unemployed than college graduates. Forty percent of 16-24 year old dropouts receive some form of government assistance. 

Section 3: At the age of 18 teenagers are now considered legal adults. These young adults are now allowed to vote, join the military, buy a house, and make their own decisions.	

Section 4: Making the dropout age 18 instead of 17 will:
	•	Decrease the dropout rate;
	•	Graduating and earning their diploma will offer them better job opportunities;
	•	Decrease the unemployment rate.
	•	Decrease the number of people who receive government assistance.

Section 5:	When signed into law, the dropout age will be changed to 18 on July 1, 2016.

An Act to Reduce Domestic Violence in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state punishments for Domestic Violence are as follows:
	•	First offense: fine of $1,000-$2,500 or up to 30 days in jail.
	•	Second offense: fine of $2,000-$5,000 and 30 days to 1 year.
	•	Third offense: 1-5 years in jail.   

Section 2: This bill would increase the amount of days spent in jail and require participation in a rehabilitation program for the offender paid for by the offender. These services will be provided by the South Carolina Department of Social Services.  The offender’s fine will pay for the therapy.	

Section 3: South Carolina is currently ranked second highest in the nation for 
deaths caused by domestic violence.  Because South Carolina’s laws regarding 
domestic violence are so lenient, many offenders become repeat offenders.   
Almost seventy-five percent of male abusers were abused as children.  By requiring 
participation in a rehabilitation program for offenders, they will better understand 
the cycle of abuse and how to prevent it.

Section 4: Because domestic violence rates are so high, the punishments need to 
be increased.  In addition to longer jail sentences, offenders will also be required to 
attend rehabilitation therapy to try to keep them from committing this crime 
again.  The fines they would receive would go towards therapy for the offender.  

Section 5: The updated punishments would include:
	•	First offense criminals would pay for their rehabilitation therapy with their fines and spend up to three months in jail.
	•	Second offense criminals would spend three months to one year in jail as well as participate in rehabilitation therapy.
	•	Third and subsequent offense criminals would spend up to five years in jail in addition to the required rehabilitation therapy.	
Section 6:	When signed into law, these updated regulations will go into effect January 1, 2016.

An Act to Benefit Homeowners with Energy-Efficient Lighting

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: For homeowners with energy-efficient lighting, an income tax reduction benefit of 0.25% will be offered.

Section 2: Every year, much of the energy consumed by the U.S. is wasted through transmission, heat loss and inefficient technology. This is costing businesses and American families extra money, and is also leading to increased carbon pollution.

Section 3: For the home’s lighting to be considered energy-efficient, there must be full use of LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lights). 

Section 4: CFLs are 4 times more efficient and last up to 10 times longer than incandescents. CFLs use 50-80% less energy than incandescents.

Section 5: The tax reduction benefits would apply to all of the following: taxpayers having a home constructed that meets the lighting requirements, homeowners who wish to replace the lights so as to meet the requirements, taxpayers moving into a previously occupied home that meets insulation requirements.

Section 5: The benefits would be removed from the following: homeowners who choose to downgrade home lighting from the requirement to below the requirement, and taxpayers moving from a home with the lighting requirement to a home with lighting below the given requirement.

Section 6: The lighting provider would be responsible for the distribution and installation of a home’s lights, and the contractor would be responsible for maintaining records on the homeowner’s lighting efficiency. The taxpayer/homeowner would then notify the contractor in a written statement of their desire to have a home constructed with energy-efficient, requirement-meeting lighting, or to renovate a home to follow these changes in lighting. Following that, the contractor is responsible for notifying the South Carolina Department of Revenue, which is the state income tax collector, of the homeowner’s lighting information.

Section 7: The tax reduction benefits would be a reduction of 0.25% from state income tax. This benefit would be effective for any and all levels of income.

Section 8: Home inspections every five years after home construction or renovation will be provided by the SC Energy Office in order to make sure that the lighting maintains its energy-efficiency over time. These inspections will ensure that the lighting is consistent with the corresponding requirements.

Section 9: This bill will be revised every 10 years due to the change of energy-efficiency standards. The SC State Government will then make necessary changes to the requirements, and the bill will be renewed.

Section 10: Benefits of this bill include the following:
	•	Energy-efficiency and environmental improvement of required lighting
	•	Although the price of energy-efficient lights is more expensive initially, the quality will pay itself off.
	•	This bill encourages the use of energy-saving, cost-effective lighting.

Section 11: This bill will go in effect January 1, 2016, and require first renewal January 1, 2026.

A bill to remove minimum age requirement on amniocentesis

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently the only prerequisite for prenatal testing using amniocentesis is the women must be of thirty-five years of age or older.

Section 2:	Amniocentesis is a common test at the end of the first trimester where amniotic fluid, a liquid containing fetal cells and various chemicals produced by the baby, is removed from the amniotic sac and is used to test the unborn child for down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. Immediately after the test the unborn child is examined to ensure its safety and well being.  Removing the age limit on amniocentesis would allow women to be tested during pregnancy for chromosomal disorders specifically down syndrome

Section 3:  By allowing this bill to be passed, women will be allowed greater power over their body as they will be able to make more decisions regarding their well being.  The bill will allow women to exercise their personal rights and will allow women to be prepared in the case that the new child does have a chromosomal disorder or complication.

Section 4:	The bill allows for women to take a more active role in their child regardless of age.  This bill will allow women to have more control over their body, as screening will allow them to have the same choices available to women of age 35 or older.  Regardless of the decision the women makes, the decision should be theirs not the government's decision.  Allowing the government to interfere with the mother's decision is not only inappropriate but is a breach of privacy.  Having the ability to have amniocentesis will better equip a women to make better decisions as she will be knowledgeable of the state of her new child.

Section 5:	When signed this bill will be effective January 1, 2016.

An Act to Discontinue the Death Penalty

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current policy of the death penalty would be repealed. 

Section 2: Beginning on January 1, 2016, all prisoners on death row would be put into the general prison population with a life sentence and no chance for parole. Death row would no longer be an option.

Section 3: A bill such as this would decrease the amount taxpayers have to pay in order to maintain prisoners. It costs taxpayers $90,000 more each year to maintain a prisoner on death row rather than a prisoner in the general population. Cases with the death penalty cost about $1.26 million, while cases without the death penalty cost around $740,000. Morally, the elimination of the death penalty would help to end the cycle of violence. The death penalty is in violation of the 8th Amendment in the United States Constitution which states that cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited. Also the death penalty demonstrates hypocrisy within our criminal justice system.

Section 4: Revenue from this discontinuation would fund:
	•	Merit-based and need-based scholarships for students.
	•	Increased funding for schools in impoverished areas.

Section 5: When signed into law, the termination of the death penalty will take place on January 1, 2016.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATUREOF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in South Carolina, “no kill” shelters send unwanted animals away to kill shelters when they reach their intake limit.

An Act to instate a maximum concerning the time period in which a prisoner may be held in solitary confinement.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently prisoners sentenced to solitary confinement may face anywhere from a day or two up to decades in solitary. These sentences would be limited to now more than two weeks at a time.

Section 2: By setting firm limitations in the amount of time a prisoner can be held in solitary, the state will ensure that the convicts aren’t being kept from human interaction for decades on end as some are now. Thus, preventing their progression towards rehabilitation to be hindered, by lack of social skills, and lowering the skyrocketing levels of depression, anxiety, and paranoia, that prisoners acquire from being held under maximum security,

Section 3: Without a cap on the amount of time a prisoner can be kept in solitary, many have been starved of human interaction. However, by limiting the amount all solitary confinement sentences to no more than two weeks at a time prisoners will not fall victim to decades spent with nothing but hopeless walls, and their own dreary thoughts. These years spent starved of human interaction hinder the criminal’s path towards rehabilitation by not preparing them to interact in a healthy manner, which is necessary for them to learn before they can submerge back into normal society. The conditions the prisoners are held under have also been proven to impede their mental health.

Section 4: After the instatement of this two week cap, we expect to see a drastic decrease in the number of suicides that occur in this unit of confinement, as well as a development of social skills among prisoners. Knowing how to appropriately act around their fellow inmates is the first step in preparing the convicts to function regularly and safely in the outside world. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the limitations will immediately take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Require More Extensive Police Training

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: The average length of the police academy is 3-4 months. This bill will change the length of the training to 14 months, and will open more spots in the police academy. It will also provide for a facilities upgrade and a more comprehensive and realistic training program. 

Section 2: To make this possible, the tuition for the police academy will be raised from $2,150 (current cost for 3 months) to $12,450 for the new, extended training program.

Section 3: Since 9/11, over 5,000 innocent lives have been brutally taken by our police officers. With the new training, we can be more confident in the professional protection we can expect from our officers of the law. With a more productive police force, we expect the state’s overall crime rate to decrease.

Section 4: South Carolinians would benefit from this in the following ways:
	•	Residents would benefit from a highly trained police force
	•	More spots will be open in the Police Academy, which will provide more jobs for South Carolina residents
	•	The number of fatalities at the hands of police officers in South Carolina will decrease.

Section 5: Current Academy students and students who have already been accepted into the police academy will be grandfathered in to the old system. When signed, registration for the 14-month class will be opened.

Decrease Billboard Heights in Greenville

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The maximum billboard height in Greenville right now is 40 feet but it should be reduced to 30 feet. 

Section 2: Billboards are very tall and distracting when driving. Also, billboards are not attractive and make the city look dirtier and less elegant. 

Section 3: Billboard maximum heights need to be lowered because of the dangers caused by having billboards at such tall heights. When driving down the road drivers are distracted by the tall billboards as they are meant to be vibrant or eye-catching for advertisement reasons. Also, the billboards cause Greenville and other cities throughout South Carolina to look dirty and unattractive. These reasons result in car wrecks which slow traffic and use money for anything the wreck damaged that is owned by the city. Also, the if our cities look dirtier and unattractive tourism goes down and the amount of money gained from taxes also goes down. Billboard maximum heights need to be lowered.

Section 4: After this proposal is enacted our state average car wrecks will be lowered and tax revenue will begin to rise. If our average car wrecks go down and our tax revenue goes up we gain money that can be used in areas like fixing roads or infrastructure. Although our taxes may be used to lower the billboards we benefit from a gain in jobs and lowering the billboards is a one time fee while the money gained as a result is everlasting.

An Act to Increase Body Reflectors Worn at Night

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: The current law of not having to wear body reflectors at night would be changed to having to wear them at night.    
 
Section 2: The state will create a law stating that you must wear body reflectors while riding a bike or walking at night.  Thus, the not having a law about body reflectors at night would be changed to having to wear body reflectors at night saving a little under 70,000 people per year.
 
Station 3: Because body reflectors would cost money and some people wouldn’t be able to afford high priced ones the state would sell them overall for $1.50 so everyone will have one. 
 
Section 4: The effect this bill would have is:
	•	Save the lives of innocent people running or biking when it’s dark
	•	Protect people from being hit by cars and other motor vehicles
	•	Decrease the cost of injury healthcare
	•	Prevent car crashes that were a result of unseen pedestrians/bikers
 
Section 5:  When signed into law, the law will take place on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An act to impose a penalty enhancement statute on hate crimes

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: South Carolina is one of only 5 states in the United States that does not have a hate crime law.  Currently, there are 21 extremist hate groups in South Carolina, a high number for a relatively small state.  As reported by the FBI, there was almost one hate crime in America in every hour of every day in 2007, totaling to over 7,600 crimes. Although South Carolina is covered by federal hate-crime defining laws, there is now law that specifies tougher sentencing or widens the group of people who can be victims of hate crimes.  This causes many hate crimes to go unreported and unseen.  Whenever a bias-motivated crime is committed, the victim’s entire community is left feeling victimized, vulnerable, fearful, isolated, and unprotected by the law. Such crimes can also lead to reprisals and a dangerous spiral of escalating inter-group tension and violence. Racial, ethnic, and religious minorities and gay people are more likely to be targeted for—and therefore need greater protection from—crime.

Section 2: A ‘hate crime’ is defined as Congress as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation”. Criteria for determining if a crime is a hate crime include but are not solely limited to:  defendant’s membership in a group that espouses hatred for certain groups (such as a black separatist group or an online chat group that opposes homosexuality), defendant’s possession of literature or symbols associated with bias, such as memorabilia or cell phone messages, emails, or posts on social media, defendant’s own writings, graffiti, or tattoos, the use of biased slurs or graffiti during or at the site of the crime, and other hate crimes committed by defendant. State law enforcement will declare the crime as a hate crime, or federal investigation will deem the crime as a hate crime, as declared in the federal law: Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 

Section 3: When signed into law, this bill will impose a penalty enhancement statute on crimes defined specifically as hate crimes by law enforcement.  This means an increase in the legal punishment for crimes committed with a biased motivation under the South Carolina state government. 

Section 4: This bill intends to only increase the penalty on true crimes with a bias against a particular group, including, but not limited to: race, religion, disability, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation.  The intention of this bill is not to criminalize the speech or opinion of bias against those groups. For example, it will not criminalize a religious leader preaching against homosexuality, because preaching is not a crime. 

Section 5: The statues to be imposed with this bill include but are not limited to: Statutes that provide for extra punishment if the defendant commits any crime in whole or in part because the victim belongs to an enumerated group. (require or allow prison time or monetary fines to be added to the penalty for the underlying offense, and those that provide for the degree of the underlying offense to be increased in severity). 

Section 6: When signed into law, the penalty enhancement statute policy will come into effect on January 1, 2016.

All footage recorded must be released at the time of any trial or cases that the footage is in question or pending judicial review.  Money for these cameras, if needed, will come from a percentage of the speeding tickets from the state.

Section 4: This will help to free innocent police officers of a guilty ruling, while putting the officers who are guilty of brutality or mishandling in jail.

An Act to Allow for Arts Education in the Special Needs Classroom.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The key entities that will be impacted by this proposal will be special
needs students throughout the state.

Section 2: Throughout the state, special needs students are suffering from a lack of arts education in their classrooms. Arts education is proven to help special needs students with communication, social, and fundamental life skills because their creativity is praised and accepted, unlike other aspects of the special education program which do not and cannot account for the individuality of each student in particular (i.e. math). This proposal will help special needs students throughout the state with task of life that will better their chances of conforming, thriving, and excelling in their daily lives in their communities and states.

Section 3: We propose that this law will allow special needs students throughout
the state to participate in arts education that will better their learning, making them more likely to succeeded in the real world. 

Section 4: To fund this project, a state tax would be imposed on the purchase of SC lottery tickets, along with the current federal tax on the tickets staying the same and not impacting or affecting this project in any way. Charging a tax of five cents per ticket in the state would create a revenue for the purpose of special needs arts education of $1,396,263.825 weekly. (Information comprised from SC state lottery data)

Section 5: After the bill is enacted into law, it will ensure that every special needs classroom throughout the state will receive some amount of funding directly from the state to ensure that arts education programs will be a part of their curriculum. The school districts throughout the state may compile funds for their schools to standardize an arts education regiment or they may leave the funds to individual schools for their planning of arts education in individual classrooms.
Section 6: If this bill is passed into law, it will be in affect starting at the first day of the 2016-2017 school year.

ONE TO ONE TECHNOLOGY

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill will require the SC Department of Education to provide Chromebooks to all public middle and high school students. The Chromebooks will replace existing text books and all computer labs.

Section 2: Providing Chromebooks to all middle and high school students will give all students access to the most current information and technology.  Chromebooks will give students the ability to research online, to prepare presentations, and to organize and share information with teachers and classmates.  Schools will
be able to repurpose existing computer labs and will no longer need to maintain portable computer carts.  This will free up both space and money for the local schools.  Currently, some schools in SC provide Chromebooks or similar computers, and we believe that every student should have access to this
technology regardless of where they live.  Finally, by replacing textbooks with Chromebooks, schools will save money, students will no longer have to carry heavy textbooks in their backpacks, and less paper will be needed for book printing.

Section 3: This bill requires the SC Department of Education to provide Chromebooks to all public middle and high school students.  The Chromebooks will replace existing textbooks and will be distributed by schools each fall and collected at the end of the school year.   Funding for this bill will come from money saved from no longer purchasing textbooks.   Any additional funding will come through the Department of Education.

Section 4: This bill will result in SC students being better prepared for college and future careers.  Students will have access to the best, most current information and will be confident using computers in their day to day work. It will also cause students to be more excited about learning.   By providing this resource to our students, we will be giving them the best opportunity to be competitive with students across the nation and worldwide.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will go into effect for the 2016/ 17 school year.

An Act to Prevent Recurring Domestic Violence

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The entities impacted are the victim in the act, the offender, the parole officer of the offender, now partners of the offender, and the citizens living around the offender.

Section 2: There is a need for preventing domestic violence because if you have been charged before then you may not be afraid to do it again. Research shows that South Carolina has been number one in the nation for deadly violence against women for the eighteenth year in a row. Domestic violence is not limited to women, it is also occurring toward men, children, and the elderly.

Section 3: With this bill the offender will have to register as a domestic violence offender, have their parole officer come visit them one time every two months, tell their now partner that they have previously been an offender, and the offender has to go through with all sentencing and treatment within three years of sentencing. Their sentence cannot be shortened or revoked.

Section 4: The results of the bill are the following but are not limited to:
	•	The recurring domestic violence would decrease;
	•	More people would be aware of the offenders in their area;
	•	With the new law it is less likely to happen again.

Section 5: When signed into law, the law will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Reduce Drunk Tattoos

Section 1: Every year, many people go to a bar and then wake up at home with an unfortunate tattoo that they have no recollection and wish that they had not gotten it. This would prevent tattoos like that from happening. 

Section 2:	 All tattoo parlors will be required to administer a breathalyzer test to customers before they get their tattoo(s). 

Section 3:	 However, some people prefer to be drunk when they get their tattoo(s) so that they will not remember the pain involved in getting their tattoo. In this case, the customers can go to the tattoo parlor in advance, and sign a waiver stating that they will be returning in an intoxicated state and will specify the tattoo(s) that they want and where they want it. They will later be allowed to come in drunk and get the tattoo they requested earlier. 

Section 4:	 Benefits of this law are:
	•	Save many people from embarrassing tattoos
	•	Save people from losing their job in a workplace that does not allow employees to have tattoos that are not able to be covered
	•	Help save people money from trying to get their tattoo removed.

Number of students + (number of professors)(average salary) + (other expenses and funding)*

*This equation does not include room and board costs

Section 3:	 This law would help our fellow citizens by having more students be able to attend colleges of their choice without finances getting in the way.

An Act to Reduce the Amount of Standardized Tests Given to Students

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: After the passing of the No Child Left Behind Act on January 8, 2002, annual State spending on standardized testing increased 160%, reaching $1.1 billion in 2008, according to the Pew Center on the States.

Section 2: Standardized testing is not beneficial for non-English speaking students or students who have special needs. Students with special needs take the same test as those without disabilities, so average testing scores are not accurate. The same is done with non-English speaking students, who are given the test before they have mastered the language, affecting the accuracy of the testing average.

Section 3: Standardized testing would not be completely eliminated, as there is some value in taking standardized tests occasionally to track academic growth over time. Instead, standardized testing would be reduced to once every school year.

Section 4: Benefits from this act:
	•	Reduced stress for students
	•	Reduce annual funding for standardized tests, allowing for the money to be used elsewhere
	•	Teachers do not have to “teach to the test”, and can instead give students general knowledge rather than specifics to memorize
	•	Can invest more time and money in adequately evaluating test scores, reducing costly mistakes made when scoring

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will go into effect at the start of the 2016-2017 school year.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1:  In the South Carolina Code of Laws in Chapter 2, Article 1, Section 56-2-100 it states that a low speed vehicle may be operated only on a highway for which the posted speed limit is 35 miles an hour or less.

An Act to Decree November as Wild Hog Hunting Month

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The most recent count of wild hogs in South Carolina is estimated at 150,000.

An Act to Have all South Carolina Public Schools to Have Internet Awareness Responsibility Training Programs

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  On average in the United States, one in five teenagers have been approached by an unwanted predator.  Our bill will provide a program in school so that students can fully be aware of the dangers of the internet.  The internet is a perfect place for predators, they can lie about anything they want to.  Most of them are also master influencers and they know how to talk to children/teenagers in a way where we feel comfortable thinking that they are our friends.  75% of teenagers are willing to share personal information online about their family in exchange for goods.  77% of the targets are from ages 14 years old and up.

Section 2: Our program will be able to inform children and teach them the warning signs to know if you are talking to a predator or not.  Also it will teach children how to predator groom which is a way to tell if you are talking to a child or not.  Only 25% of youth tell adults about being approached by a predator.  The other 75% need a program that will help them share what happened to them.  So if that were to happen again then they would know what to do.

Section 3: The program will also teach youth how to tell if someone on social media is being serious and posting real threats.  When someone posts any threat on a social media page, or any blog a person needs to know how to be aware of these things, and this program will show them how.  This could save lives, because most people will not take these seriously.

Section 4: When signed into law this bill will take place the School Year of 2016-2017.

An Act to Increase the Cigarette Tax for Veterans

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state cigarette tax of $0.57 per pack of cigarettes would be increased to $0.63 per pack of cigarettes, an increase of about $0.06 per pack of cigarettes.

Section 2: The state tax will only increase for one year.  So, the average cost of a pack of cigarettes in South Carolina will increase from $5.58 to $5.64 in 2016, and then go back to its original price of $5.58 in 2017.

Section 3: The state tax would provide $18,925,980 of funds to be distributed evenly to the veterans on the Veteran’s Administration waiting list.

Section 4: The revenue from this tax would:
	•	Provide the 7,000 veterans on the VA Hospital waiting list with a lump-sum of money which would amount to around $2,703 per veteran
	•	The money would be put into a South Carolina Healthcare account which would only be available for use in South Carolina for veterans only
	•	Veterans on the VA Hospital waiting list would be the only ones to get the lump-sum payment. 

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1, 2016, and cease effect on January 1, 2017.

An act to label consumer produce with all pesticides and herbicides involved in production

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In the United States, based on extra-population hospital surveys, an estimated 20,000 people received emergency medical care for suspected pesticide poisoning in 2014. This bill shall assist in lowering this number substantially by labeling all non-organic produce designated for consumption with a list of all pesticides and herbicides used in production.

Section 2: Humans are often susceptible to prolonged exposure of harmful pesticides and herbicides which are known to cause adverse health concerns which are not always discoverable in short-term studies. With the labeling of all pesticides and herbicides present in consumer produce, people will be better informed about exactly what they are putting inside of their own bodies, leading to increased awareness and prevention of the possibility of poisoning.

Section 3: Funding shall not be required by the state of South Carolina, but rather by the producers who must fund labeling themselves. Companies and brands who fail to comply when signed into law shall have their product halted from reaching the shelves of South Carolina retail locations until compliance has been declared.

Section 4: The Consumer Protection Division (CPD) of the South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) shall be responsible for the enforcement of this bill.

Section 5: When signed into law, compliance is required beginning June 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Ensure Gun Education and Safety

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This act would increase the amount of gun education required to obtain a Concealed Weapons Permit by creating a mandatory class that would last a minimum of 5 hours.  Would you trust a teenager who has never driven nor taken a class on driving to drive you somewhere? I didn’t think so. The same thing goes for carrying a concealed weapon.  If the average citizen has a Concealed Weapons Permit (also known as a CWP) and does not know anything about gun safety or guns in general it could negatively affect people around them.  It is important for people who are trying to get a CWP to know gun safety and general gun knowledge so they can be responsible gun owners. 

Section 2: A course with a minimum of 5 hours is important because it teaches necessary information such as properly loading and unloading a firearm, cleaning a gun, fixing a jam, firing the gun, etc.  It is important to have a mandatory course so people seeking to obtain a Concealed Weapons Permit know how to properly operate and safely own a firearm.  Before obtaining a CWP one has to take a test and pass it.  The class will be something extra (and mandatory) to educate those who want to obtain a CWP and general gun knowledge and safety. 

Section 3: This bill does not require funding because the state government does not have to pay money to administer the course.  The course is administered by a SLED licensed instructor who pays money to become an instructor.  Those that are seeking to obtain a CWP would pay for the course themselves, not the tax payer. 

Section 4: The bill will be enforced by SLED (South Carolina Law Enforcement Division) and the South Carolina police departments.  The penalty of not taking the course will be it will be impossible for them to obtain a permit.  The penalty for a person not possessing a concealed weapons permit but still carrying a concealed weapon will be criminal charges.  These charges include concealed carry without a permit and loaded carry without a permit, which can result in 10 year loss of gun rights.
Section 5: This bill will go into effect once signed by the governor on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Implement In-Road Warning Lights

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, South Carolina ranks fourth in the nation for highest percentage of pedestrian fatalities in comparison to the overall population (According to USAtoday.com). This ranking is based on the documentation of 90 pedestrian deaths during 2010. Furthermore, the number has increased over the past several years, rising to 106 deaths in 2014.

Section 2: Our law will increase the very few existing in-pavement warning lights in South Carolina. These flashing LED lights alert motorists before and while a pedestrian is crossing a crosswalk. They are placed so that they are directly within motorists’ sight and can easily be seen during the day or night. This law will be able to limit the number of pedestrian fatalities by implementing these lights at places where crosswalks are primarily needed, such as schools and churches.

Section 3: The execution and maintenance of the lights will be funded by vehicle registration fees. Two additional registration fee dollars will be collected from each individual annually to pay for this system that will greatly reduce the amount of pedestrian-car accidents. If two dollars is collected from the more than 3 million registered vehicles in South Carolina, then it will be possible to insert the crosswalk lights at all schools with existing crosswalks.

Section 4: Revenue from the additional dollars on the registration fee would fund: 
	•	Cost of the in-pavement lights
	•	Insertion and maintenance

Section 5: The department of transportation will enforce this bill because it will provide protection for pedestrians, motorists, and it will reduce accidents.

Section 6: After being signed into law, this bill will take effect on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to require Pediatricians Interaction with Patients be Supervised by Parents/Guardians

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This act would restrict pediatricians from meeting with their patients alone.  A parent/guardian of the patient must be in the room while the Pediatrician treats the patient.  The reason a parent/guardian should be present is to protect the patient/child from possible bad intentions of the Pediatrician. A contract that is given to the parent by the pediatric office will be signed by the parent/guardian, the child’s pediatrician, and the office. If a parent wants to or needs to leave the room, the doctor will have to verbally enforce the contract. If the parent does leave the room, they will be fined as much as the pediatric office would because they would both be breaking the law.

Section 2: Our goal for this bill is to prevent pediatricians from harming and harassing their patients. We will make it illegal for the parent or guardian to leave the pediatrician and patient alone.  There have been four major cases in the United States which consisted of male pediatricians molesting and sexually harassing their male and female patients. In total, several hundred children from the early age of 3 months to 18 years old have been victims.

Section 3: We will fund this bill by requiring a 5 percent addition to the fee when people sign their child up for pediatric care. This fee will fund the contract that pediatric offices will need to print and/or copy. This is because the cost of printing a contract for every person that joins will add up to a high price that most offices probably will not want to pay for and it will become inconvenient for the office’s budgets.

Section 4: The way that we will enforce this bill is partially by the contract, but if the contract is broken, then the pediatric office will face a fine from 500 dollars up to 1000 dollars depending on how severe the case. The severity of the case will be determined by the local law enforcement.
Section 5: This bill will go into effect January 01, 2016 after being signed by the governor.

An Act to Allow SCDNR to Control Game Laws Concerning Season Dates, and Bag Limits for Turkey and Deer State Wide.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: South Carolina relies on its Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) for input and help on managing deer and turkey seasons state wide.  However the SCDNR controls season dates and limits for deer in the upstate only (game zones one and two). While deer season dates and limits are controlled by the General Assembly below Columbia (game zones three and four). Turkey seasons however are controlled state wide by the General Assembly. It is ineffective to have two different state organizations in charge of one topic. Our bill aims to allow SCDNR to control the bag limits and season dates for deer and turkey season of the entire state as opposed to only game zone one and two.  

Section 2: South Carolina contains a variety of different habitats within its state and game zones. These areas range from foothills, to mountains, to coastal plains. These different areas are affected by different environmental issues involving declining populations, over population, predation of species by coyotes, armadillos, and other invasive species. South Carolina Department of Natural Resources is an organization of environment and biological scientists who more qualified to make judgements concerning South Carolina’s environment as opposed to the General Assembly who consists of politicians.

Section 3: Our bill would not necessarily need funding because the SCDNR is already a funded organization. Regardless, to promote funding for SCDNR, out of state hunting licenses will be raised by 10%. 

Section 4: South Carolina Department of Natural Resources will enforce this bill. 

Section 5: This bill will go into effect at the start of the 2016 turkey season, March 20th, and deer hunting season, August 1st.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Make Hate Crimes Illegal

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: South Carolina is one of the only states in the country that does not have a hate crime law.  It would protect people from being targeted because of  their face, religion, gender, age, or sexual orientation.  There are only a total of five states without such a law, South Carolina, Arkansas, Wyoming, Georgia and Michigan.  One recent case shows the need for such a law.  It was the shooting of nine African American members of Emanuel AME Church in Charleston.  The accused shooter, Dylan Roof, told investigators he killed them because he wanted to start a race war.  He is charged with nine counts of murder by the State of South Carolina.  But there is no hate crime law here.  He had to be charged by the U.S. Attorney to face hate crime charges on the federal level. 

Section 2: Our hate crime bill would make the punishments stronger for people who commit crimes because of their hate toward a group of people.  We believe if someone is assaulted or threatened during a hate crime, they should get a tougher sentence.  We think time in prison should be added to any case where someone is convicted of a hate crime.  Right now, most police do not report hate crimes to the state.  That makes it very hard to know how many there are.  We think there should also be a requirement that the State Law Enforcement Division should keep track of hate crimes.  The last report in South Carolina said there were 51 hate crimes.  That was in 2013.  We think because most police departments do not report those types of cases, the number is much higher.  

Section 3: The bill would not need to be funded any more than police departments and sheriff’s offices are already funded.  The same officers or deputies that work on a crime case now, would just add that charge if they believe it is a hate crime.  The prosecutors and judges would push for the punishment and hand down the sentence.  It would not add any more money to these cases.  It would possibly prevent crime down the road, by stopping others from committing hate crimes.  That would mean less people in prison and money saved from keeping them behind bars.
Section 4:  We believe current law enforcement in the state would enforce the hate crime law. 

Section 5:  This bill should go into effect on January 1, 2016 with the signature of the youth governor.

An Act to abolish smoking in all public places in SC.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The act of smoking is taking in thousands of harsh and toxic chemicals that are very damaging to ones body. Smoking is very addicting and not only pollutes our bodies, but our air and water too. It affects our environment when people dispose of cigarettes improperly. Second hand smoke can also cause many health issues such as cancer, lung disease, COPD, heart diseases, respiratory infections, and can lead to strokes. 53,800 people die a year from secondhand smoke exposure. Many people have received illnesses and in some cases, die due to exposure to second hand smoke. This bill would stop people from smoking in public areas, to prevent secondhand smoking and reduce the amount of polluting our air and water.
 
Section 2: With our bill anyone who is in a public area and is seen smoking or leaving any trace of a cigarette will face a series of consequences. The first offence will be a $100.00 fine. The second offense will be a charge of $550.00 fine. The third offense will be a charge of $800.00. The fourth offense and all additional offense will be 3 days of jail time and $1000.00 fine.

Section 3: Our bill will be funded by increasing the current tax on cigarettes by .02 cents and through the revenue generated by the program fines.

Section 4: The local police will enforce this bill through their normal monitoring of the community. People can also report to their local law enforcement if they see someone violating this law.

Section 5: Our bill will go into effect on January 01, 2016 with the signature of the governor.

Educator’s Concealed Weapons Act - An act to provide extra security to all students and staff members in South Carolina Schools.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: School shootings have been a major problem in the United States recently. Many people have been injured because of the lack of security and protection provided inside schools. We would like to propose a bill that further protects the members of school systems in South Carolina. Schools should have the ability to defend against possible threats to the wellbeing of students and/or staff. Educator’s Concealed Weapons Act enables certified teachers to carry a concealed weapon (either nonvisible on their person or locked in a safe out of student reach) on school grounds for the protection and defense of all individuals on the premises.

Section 2: Educator’s Concealed Weapons Act allows certified teachers to carry concealed weapons on school grounds in order to provide protection for the individuals at the school. Just as we have CPR certified teachers, we will have firearm certified teachers. In order to become a firearm certified teacher, one must be allowed to legally own a firearm in the United States. One must complete the minimum amount of certification and firearm training. Each school district in SC will determine if additional training is required to carry a weapon in that district. The certified teachers will remain anonymous. One must keep the weapon on their person and out of sight or locked away and out of reach of any student. If firearm is lost or improperly used, certification will be immediately revoked and punishment will be decided based on state law concerning mishandling a weapon. This bill allows for better defense against threats and an overall safer learning environment. 

Section 3: This bill will be funded by raising sales tax on all firearms. There will also be a small additional cost to purchase the permit that allows one to carry the gun on school grounds. Purchasers in the state of South Carolina will be paying for the extra protection of children at school or school sponsored events. 

Section 4: The state School Board of Education will enforce this bill. They will communicate the regulations and requirements of the new law to districts and districts will oversee that the law is properly followed. All other aspects of this bill (i.e. quantity of firearms and extent of training) is up to the discretion of the school districts. 

Section 5: This bill will go into effect on August 1, 2016 before the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Repeal The Voter ID Law

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Voter Fraud is an illegal procedure in which a person impersonates a citizen to cast a vote under their name. The Voter ID act sought to quell this trend of false voters. This law has not only failed to staunch the fraudulent voter numbers, it has barred several demographics from voting during election time. Voter identification laws have become increasingly strict over the years, and due to this, many U.S citizens cannot afford to obtain a proper driver’s license. Examples of these people are: impoverished persons, elderly, and the ill. Currently, there are many people in South Carolina are alienated due to harsh voting registration laws. This causes those individuals to be at a loss when election time rolls around. The lack of foresight used when passing the current voter ID laws restrict the demographics that can vote, and are on the verge of infringing on constitutional rights. 

Section 2: This new act will repeal the most recent Voter ID law, allowing for SC citizens to vote without the requirement of a Photograph ID. This will grant impoverished individuals their right to vote, while maintaining a strict lock on voter fraud. 

Section 3: This new act does not require additional funding. Rather, due to the aforementioned repealing, less state funds will be needed because of the cease of printing Voting Registration cards.

Section 4: The State Elections will procure a list of all eligible voters within a county border. This list will be checked before an elector is allowed into the polling area. An officer shall be on guard to remove any person who attempts to falsify a vote. 

Section 5: The bill will be signed into law and be put into January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to put a student representative on the Board of Education to better improve South Carolina schools.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In our schools today there are many student councils that give more insight into a student perspective in a school environment. This is just in individual schools. This bill proposes that a student representative be on the South Carolina Board of Education in order to provide policy makers with a student prospective on potential policies.  This will hopefully help alleviate many student issues with authority because they will have a voice for themselves in the educational mechanics. 

Section 2:
	•	Interested Student Body Presidents from South Carolina public schools would apply for the chance to become the student representative on the board. The board would then interview, if needed, the candidates that they believe will best fit the role. The board would narrow it down and have a vote on who will be their student representative. There will be a new student representative elected each year. 
	•	The representative will be responsible for attending every Board of Education meeting. During these meetings the representative will be contributing their insight about any form of conflict, or anything that dramatically effects the student population. Also, the representative will be responsible gathering student feedback on potential policy proposals and present those proposals to the board.

Section 3: This bill needs minimal funding if any at all. If the student representative cannot afford the cost of transportation to get to the meetings, then gas mileage will be reimbursed based on the state approved numbers. The student representative position is voluntary.  

Section 4: The SC State Board of Education will be responsible for enforcing this bill. Current board members will oversee the application process each year.  If the student representative fails to make a mandatory board meeting, then a new student representative will be selected among those who applied that year.

Section 5: The bill should go into effect this next May, 2016. The bill is predicted to go in effect in May because, it allows time for arrangements to be made both in advertising this opportunity to new student body presidents and allow the board to establish a fair application and selection process.

An Act for a Better Education

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In South Carolina, the average high school classroom has 30 kids in each class.  Having this many students in each classroom effects the way students learn in a negative way.  This bill will decrease the amount of students in each classroom, which will improve the quality of education.  

Section 2: Researchers suspect that class size reduction helps students achieve more because there is a greater opportunity for individual interaction between student and teacher in a smaller class. Teaching a smaller class reduces the amount of stress for the teacher, which creates a better learning environment for the students.  This gives the students more opportunities to increase their learning by asking questions.  Each class should have between 20-25 students per teacher.   

Section 3: In order to resolve this problem, each school will need more teachers to ensure that the students receive better preparation and guidance.  South Carolina will fund this by raising the sales tax .1% for each dollar spent.  The extra cent from each dollar will go to the department of education which will be used to pay for teachers as well as more classrooms and everything a classroom needs.  

Section 4: The school district will enforce this bill.

Section 5: This bill will go into effect once signed by the governor and the school district at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Repeal the Legalization of Beating Wives on Court House Steps on Sundays

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In the State of South Carolina it is perfectly legal to beat your wife on Sunday on the Court House steps. This is both unacceptable and absurd. Our state government should not allow such a law to remain in effect in today’s society.

Section 2: As America has focused more on equality, this law opposes the equality movement.  The equality of women to men is especially imperative to our state if we wanting to grow both our economy and society. That is why we need to repeal the act that says it is legal for a man to beat his spouse on the steps of the Court House. Any other form of domestic violence is illegal in our state; this specific day and place should not be of any exception. 

Section 3: There is no need for extra funding for this repeal.  The repeal will take place in the SC state legislature.  Domestic violence prevention and protection for the common citizen are already being funded by the state legislature. Both the Police Department and Social Services already enforce law prohibiting domestic violence.

Section 4: The Justifications for the repeal are as followed:
	•	According to Linsey Graham, a senator of South Carolina, the state of South Carolina has the highest rate of domestic violence per capita in the country and banning this law could potentially lower the rate of domestic violence 
	•	South Carolina’s female citizens should know that they are protected by the government at all times and locations. 
	•	Throughout our state this law exhibits inequality, which should be abolished. 
	•	All other forms of domestic violence are illegal, therefore this law should be no exception.

Section 5: This Bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Permit Adoptees to Obtain Original Birth Certificates and Other Relevant Information

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  South Carolina adoption records were closed and have remained confidential since 1963 in order to protect the identities of both birth and adoptive parents. It is currently impermissible, by law, for an adoptee to gain vital documents such as an original birth certificate (OBC), adoption records and family medical history without petitioning the court in which the records were finalized. With this being enforced, adoptees do not have access to the same information as other citizens, hindering their medical treatment and civil rights.

Section 2:  We propose a law to open adoption records in South Carolina. This will allow the Department of Social Services (DSS) to disclose these records providing a legal way for adoptees over the age of eighteen to receive original birth certificates, adoption records and family medical history on request. Acquiring these documents will grant the adoptee knowledge of his/her origin as well as improve the treatment and prevention of hereditary diseases in the adoptee and family. Having this information will also provide the adoptee the option to initiate contact with the birth family. With the current law, the birth parents’ confidentiality supersedes the adoptee’s rights to information. However, it is clearly stated in the Children’s Code of South Carolina that when in conflict, the rights of the adoptee should always take precedence over the rights of the birth parents.

Section 3: The process in which an adoptee must follow to obtain these records is as follows:
	•	The adoptee must fill out the “Application for Adopted File”. This file will allow anyone who was born in South Carolina and adopted to receive their records. This form must be notarized.
	•	The adoptee must provide two forms of identification (driver’s license, social security card, passport, etc.)
	•	The adoptee must provide a check for $35 to the Department of Social Services for the processing of records.
	•	The application, forms of identification, and the check for $35 must be sent to the Department of Social Services via U.S Mail.
	•	The original birth certificate, adoption records, and medical history of the biological family will be retrieved and sent back to the adoptee via U.S. Mail.

Section 4:  This bill will have minimal costs and fund itself.  With the $35 check from each individual, the Department of Social Services will be able to pay for any necessary expenses pertaining to the release of adoption records.  

Section 5:  The government agency enforcing this bill will be the SC Department of Social Services. They will be in charge of the managing and mailing of records to applicants.

Section 6:  This bill will be signed and put into effect on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Reduce the Reliance Upon Natural Gas and Coal for Energy

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Natural gas and coal account for about 46.7% of the state’s electricity generation. South Carolina produces neither natural gas or coal, it is all imported from other areas. The price of natural gas for residential buildings and housing is about 64% higher than the average throughout the U.S. A tax break and grants are proposed for the companies that invest in other forms energy that are alternatives to fossil fuels. This is to reduce the reliance upon them and to promote the use of in-state sources such as nuclear energy. South Carolina has many nuclear plants, including Carolinas–Virginia Tube Reactor, Catawba Nuclear Station, Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant, H. B. Robinson Nuclear Generating Station, William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station, Oconee Nuclear Station, and Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Generating Station, that can be expanded and also many rivers that can be utilized for hydroelectric power.

Section 2: The current business income tax in South Carolina is 5%. As an incentive to power companies, the tax will be removed from any company that can reduce its electricity production from coal and natural gas to 10% of total production or below. These companies will also be able to apply for grants to help invest in facilities and equipment necessary for using alternative energy sources. The grants will pay up to 25% of the price of the facilities and/or equipment. To be eligible for a grant, a company must provide documentation of what they wish to purchase and for what purpose. If the reason for the purchase is seen fit, the state will pay a certain percentage of the price based off of the foreseen benefits of how much clean power will be produced.

Section 3:  In order to be able to pay for this endeavor, the state will be raising the income tax on power plants that have over 10% of power generation coming from fossil fuel burning to 15%. This will not only pay for the grants and make up for the tax benefits provided by the state for power plants that use less than 10% fossil fuels, but also push other power plants that aren’t willing to make the transition, feel like they need to.
Section 4: If any company that has not had to pay income tax goes above 10% of their electricity being produced by coal and natural gas, the 5% tax will be reintroduced and will account for the entire year of when it is reintroduced. The tax increases and decreases involved with this bill will be regulated by the IRS who will ensure that each company pays its due every year. Companies will have to reach and maintain their 10% electricity produced by fossil fuels goal in order to receive a steady flow of tax benefits. Any company that receives a grant must use the money for the documented purpose, otherwise they will face charges of fraud and never be eligible for any tax breaks or grants from the state. This bill will be enforced by the South Carolina Department of Energy who will determine which companies are eligible for tax breaks and if need be, which companies must return to the original tax rate. The South Carolina Department of Energy will also keep documentation of grants and ensure that the provided money goes towards its intended purpose.

Section 5: The benefits of this bill are as follows:
	•	To help with the reduction of out of state dependency 
	•	To be able to start using and implementing sustainable forms of energy
	•	The overall South Carolinian environment will be a lot cleaner.
	•	Other states will be inspired to create programs similar to South Carolina’s

Section 6: This bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to raise the minimum wage

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The minimum wage in South Carolina is $7.25 per hour based off of the set federal minimum wage.  

Section 2: This wage is lower than the projected living wage in South Carolina, set at $10.49 per hour for a household with 1 adult. No one person would be able to live off of the current minimum wage, or support a family with it. For a family to live a comfortable life, this bill will propose that the minimum wage be gradually raised over a 4 year period to $11.25 per hour, averaging an increase of $1.00 each year. The transition into a higher minimum wage will allocate time for businesses to adjust to the increase of input costs. For full-time students, the employer can receive a certificate from the Department of Labor which will allow the employer to pay the student no less than 85% of the current minimum wage.  The certificate will also limit the hours that the student may work to 8 hours in a day and no more than a 20 hour work week when school is in session and a 40 hour work week when school is out, and requires the employer to follow all child labor laws. 

Section 3: The employer will have to bear the cost of this additional increase.

Section 4: The South Carolina Department of Labor will enforce these new regulations following the same guidelines that are currently in effect. 

Section 5: This bill will be signed into law and go into effect on June 1, 2016, immediately raising the minimum wage to $8.25 per hour.  Each following year on June 1st, the new minimum wage will increase by $1.00 until the year of 2019 where the wage will reach its maximum of $11.25 per hour.

An Act to Minimize Number of Students Per Classroom

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: JL Mann High School currently has an average number of 22.5 students per class. This bill will require South Carolina public high schools will require an average of no more than 15 students per class. 

Section 2: Classes can have a maximum of students of 35 currently in South Carolina. The more students in a classroom, means the less individual attention they will have.  Lower class sizes are linked to positive educational benefits such as better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates.    

Section 3: The state needs to take some initiative in funding smaller class sizes. Tobacco and alcohol taxes will be raised by $0.50. This money will fund the new teachers needed for this lower average.

Section 4: In order to maintain funding individual schools will have to report teacher- student ratios twice a year. Reports will be made 10 days after the start of school and 10 days after the start of the 3rd quarter. Each district board of education will gather school reports and make necessary funding adjustments.  

Section 5: The tax will be implemented January 1, 2016, but class sizes will not be mandated to change until August 1, 2020. This allow time for tax increases to take effect and policies to be set for the new teachers.

An Act to Distribute Electronic Textbooks throughout all SC Public Schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Today in South Carolina most schools use heavy, worn, and printed textbooks. We believe that electronic textbooks on a tablet would not only be beneficial to the schools with making students keep up with their own books, but also help improve student learning. In schools today, students are required to carry around heavy textbooks that take up space either in their book bags or lockers and keep up with them throughout the entire school year. Lost or damaged books result in fines and disciplinary actions that some students can’t afford to receive. Another issue with the textbooks is in this generation, students have learned to read and interact with electronic devices, so why not make all school textbooks accessible in electronic format.  

Section 2: Replacing textbooks with tablets can improve learning and organization of students. The inside of textbooks may contain a few quizzes, section questions and an activity or two mixed in with loads of reading. Changing to a tablet will allow students to not only access the reading needed for an assignment, but the electronic format can also allow teachers to insert updated quizzes, homework, and other files that the student may need to complete or learn a subject. Lastly, using tablets will better prepare students for the world of technology that is being used much more often in all types of professions when they enter our world's society.

Section 3: Funding for this bill will come from the SC Department of Education textbook fund.  The State Department of Education will put a bid out to various tablet manufactures and select the business with the most competitive pricing to provide a tablet for all 212,560 SC public school students. School districts will oversee that all students receive a tablet and manage any repairs and upgrades of the tablets via their IT department. Each textbook costs $70- $100 and each student will need an average of 3 textbooks each. With those expenses adding up funding for one tablet will end up being a smaller cost for the school.

Section 5: This bill with go into effect in the beginning of the 2016 school year to start students’ education off with a new learning style to begin their school year.

An Act to Make Public Four Year Baccalaureate Programs Free

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: While the national unemployment rate has decreased from 5.30 percent to 5.1 percent, between July and August of this year, the unemployment rate in South Carolina remains at 6.3 percent. The high school graduation rate in South Carolina is at 68.2 percent, however the number of individuals with a 4 year college degree is at 26.1 percent. Of the number of individuals with a 4 year college degree 55 percent struggle with debt. As our state economy continues grow and include major manufacturing and international corporations an improved workforce is essential. 

Section 2: Referring to the statistics stated in the previous section, our state lacks significant numbers of people who have advanced to higher education. Not only does the state suffer, but the people themselves suffer because they are unable to acquire the jobs necessary to support their families. This is true because with our minimum wage being $7.25 an hour most families consisting of 3 or more people fall below the poverty line. Thus proving the need for higher education is glaring because it is essential to gaining quality employment.

Section 3: South Carolina changed it's funding policy for public education in 2006, with Act 388, to collect a one percent sales tax through the South Carolina Department of Revenue. This tax and the lottery could fund public higher education.

Section 4: The state legislature will enforce the bill by ensuring that the state budget allows for the following:
	•	Maintaining public college and university facilities throughout the state.
	•	Ensuring quality faculty by providing competitive wages which will be higher than the minimum wage and determined by the individual college.

Section 5: When signed into law, the first provision for free public higher education will take place on July 1st, 2016.

An Act to Prevent Racial Questions on Job Applications and Standardized Tests

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in South Carolina, questions about one's race are asked on all standardized tests and many job applications. Many people who are biracial or of a race not mentioned have the issue of not knowing how to answer for these questions.

Section 2: This bill will alleviate the issue by not asking the question at all. Therefore, no one will be confused as to what the answer should be. 

Section 3: Racial discrimination is something that needs to be stopped. Race should not matter when applying for a job or taking a test. Eliminating these racial questions will help prevent prejudice and people will be more likely to get a job based on their merit and not their racial background. 

Section 4: The company in offense will be fined by the state for racial discrimination if they do not abide by this law.  Fines will be determined by the following graduated amounts: 
	•	1st Offense:	$1500
	•	2nd Offense: 	$3000

Section 2: We propose giving 20% tax break to companies purchasing American products to use in construction. This will boost the use of American products and will ultimately produce more income for American companies in South Carolina rather than foreign suppliers. 

Section 3: By lowering the taxes for local and nationally produced products used in construction, the appeal for these products will go up and give more money the business's in South Carolina

Section 4: By doing this, purchases for state provided products will rise, granting more money for the state.

An Act to Raise the Tax Credit for Adoptions of Special Needs Children and Children over the Age of 10

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: For people who adopt, the topic of money is a big issue. They are able to pay for the adoption, but when it comes to the payment for the resources needed, it can be a struggle. For example, people who adopt children with illnesses will have to pay an even greater amount of money and adoption already cost $30,000.

Section 2: Our bill would help defray the cost of adoption through a SC income tax credit of $2,500 in the year that the adoption is finalized and every year there after the child lives with the adopting parents. The federal government already has this law and it has been helping significantly. If the child has special needs or is over the age of 10 you will receive a $2,500 additional tax credit along with the $10,000 you should already receive. 

Section 3: When you adopt a child with special needs and/or is over the age of 10, plus you use out-of-pocket expenses, you become eligible for higher tax credit. For you and your adopted special needs child to gain higher tax credit, the child needs to be certified special needs by getting a signed declaration from the state which the adoption was final. If you have a child who is 10 or older and also has special needs, they will receive two times the amount of tax credit; which will give you $5,000.

Section 4: When signed into law, the bill will take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act of State-The Labelling of all Pesticides Used in Production of Products Sold in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: A pesticide is any substance defined as: a substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals. An herbicide is any substance defined as: a substance that is toxic to plants and is used to destroy unwanted vegetation; it is a type of pesticide. 

Section 2: The goal of this bill is to decrease the amount of pesticide poisoning in South Carolina. Among farmworkers, 10,000–20,000 pesticide poisonings occur every year. Beyond the acute poisonings, there are long-term, chronic health effects such as cancer, Parkinson's’ Disease, asthma, birth defects and neurological harms, including developmental delays and learning disabilities. Children of farmworkers are particularly at risk. Pesticides cling to workers' skin and clothing long after they return home, putting their children at risk.

Section 3: This bill would take place in the perimeters of South Carolina. All establishments and markets selling products with the chance of contamination of pesticides will be required to only sell products with the pesticides labelled on the products. 

Section 4: This bill will require no funding from the state of South Carolina; funding must be provided by the companies who produce the goods and must be verified to have the pesticides labelled by the marketplace at which they are sold. 

Section 5: When signed into law, it will take place on January 1, 2016.

In 2007 he was given the key to the city of Columbia by Mayor Coble. Following his announcement of his presidential ticket, he inquired his viewers to cast their votes by donating to Donorschoose.org, which is an online charity organization that connects individuals to classrooms in need. He acquired $68,000 in donation which gave to South Carolina classrooms, which benefitted over 14,000 low-income students.

Cases where mentally unfit persons commit more than 4 murders, or the murders were committed in cruel ways such as torture and mutilation of the victim’s or victims’ body by necrophilia or removal of appendages or organs, then the person with the mental illness will be permanently incarcerated in a mental institution. If persons intentionally fabricate insanity, said persons will be charged normally with an added sentence of 5 years.

Section 3: Persons with mental illnesses who avoid medical treatments without prior notice and good reason will be fined for each medical treatment missed. If the person cannot pay the fines, they will be incarcerated in the county prison for 1 month and, throughout that month, will be transported once a week to the medical facilities.

Section 4: One medical facility will be assigned to each county, which will repurpose any derelict that suits the needs of the medical facilities. If no there are no such buildings then one will be commissioned and built. The internal setup of these facilities will consist of one doctor for every twenty patients, four nurses for every twenty patients, and four guards for every ten patients. There will be two dedicated doctors at the facility for regular medical treatments. The mentally ill person’s Medicaid will pay for medication and treatments. Should a mentally ill person not qualify for Medicaid, they will be provided with Medicaid.

An Act to Make the Opening Day of Deer Season a State Holiday

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in South Carolina the first day of hunting season isn’t a state holiday. 

Section 2: Each year, September 15th is opening day of Bow Deer season.  The new law to recognize September 15th to the calendar as a state holiday; and employees would be excused from work and students would be excused from school.  

Section 3: If this holiday was created there would be many benefits.  
	•	Reduced number of absences at school and work
	•	Controlling the deer population
	•	Increased productivity at work and school because hunters would be more focused

Section 4: Thousands of people hunt each year in the state of South Carolina.  It is more important to make Bow Season a state holiday because after bow season, hunters are limited to the number of deer they can retrieve and they have to pay for tags.  Recognizing this particular season as a holiday, would encourage more participation.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLLINA

An act to amend the State Constitution

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current State Constitution states (in two sections) “No person who denies the existence of the Supreme Being shall hold any office under this Constitution.” Article VI section 4 and Article XVII section 4

Section 2: This bill would remove Article VI section 4 and Article XVII section 4.  This is necessary due to the confliction with article 6 of the U.S. Constitution. Specifically Oaths of office and the supreme law.

Section 3: Article VI section 4 and Article XVII section 4 should be removed because it judges you on your religion.  If a candidate doesn’t confess the existence of a supreme being, then the candidate couldn’t get hold a state office job. Situations like this conflict with the supremacy clause of the constitution.

Section 4: There are several court cases that support our bill.  One example is case 24622 - Silverman v. Campbell, et al. – 1997.

Section 5: When signed into law, state candidacy requirements would change on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Regulate Food Stamps

BE IT HERBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: Currently there are few rules on what people can buy with food stamps in South Carolina. Our bill would put restrictions on what could be purchased with food stamps.

Section 2: This bill would make the health of people much better. It would help people to make better food choices by limiting them from buying junk food with government money. Studies show that low-income families are more likely to have poor eating habits and are at higher risk of obesity. It would push them to buy more nutritious food for their families.

Section 3: Once a food stamp application gets approved, the family will get a card. Each week a certain amount of money will be put on this card. Food stamp cards with remain at $35.00 per person. Food stamp purchases would be products with positive health benefits. These include, meats, whole grains, milk, vegetables and fruits. Items not approved will be declined. The USDA would determine the foods on these lists. 

Section 4: Although there would be a base cost to determine acceptable foods in the grocery store, the benefits would be substantial.

Section 5: The bill, upon being signed, will be put into action on February 15, 2017.

“Not Today” Bill - An effort to save shirt pockets across America

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: There is currently no regulation on dunking on shirt pockets in America, but we will hope to create of stem of checks and balances to create a better America. 

Section 2: Our first will be to make illegal to dunk on shirt pockets without the proper permit. 

Section 3: Citizens will have to visit local police department and undergo a ruthless procedure involving the correct two finger form and the mass group dunk sessions which we will hope to eliminate. If citizens finish the class and pass the written, spoken, and physical parts of the test then they will be admitted licenses to dunk under proper circumstances. 

Section 4: Circumstances include:
	•	Dunking that results in the tearing shirt pocket is illegal 
	•	Dunking must consist of no more than 2 fingers
	•	Dunking will not discriminate on anybody for any reason
	•	There are certain no dunk zones where no one is allowed to dunk under any circumstances
	•	Dunkers must carry a badge at all time 

Section 5: Consequences to breaking the law include:
	•	1st offense, 30 days ban to dunking and they’re not allowed to wear shirts with pockets
	•	2nd offense, 60 days no dunking and no shirts with pockets, never allowed to get license
	•	3rd offense, 6 months incarceration and intensive sewing of shirt pockets
	•	4th offense, they can only wear black cargo shorts, denim jackets, and brown socks for the remainder of their sad pathetic lives 
Section 6: This is the right choice for America because people who choose to wear shirts with pockets will be created equal and rid of any pocket related discrimination. We will save American dollars by not forcing the common man to replace shirt pockets week after week. We will create jobs by training specialized dunk instructors to teach classes. Dunking without a permit will involve taxation that helps the country. 

Section 7: If signed, this law will begin on April 21st, 2016.

An Act to Exempt School Athletes From Physical Education

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: The current rule, that all public school students must take two courses of physical education to graduate whether they are athletes or not, would be revised so that student athletes would be exempt from physical education classes.  

Section 2: Student athletes who are in 9-12th grade exempt from physical education are already getting their needed physical activity from the sports that they take part in.     

Section 3: Since some students are involved in athletics outside of school, there would be a form available to be completed by their instructors that would verify that they are getting their physical activity and would count as an exemption as well.  

Section 4: By exempting the athletes from physical education classes:
	•	Students would have the opportunity to sign up for other elective courses that interest them;
	•	Physical Education classes would be smaller, allowing teachers to connect with and instruct students one on one and give the students the chance to participate for the whole class.
	•	Because athletes devote most of their out of school hours to their sports, there is less time for them to complete their academic work. By having an opening in their schedule, study halls are an option to complete schoolwork.  

Section 5: When signed into law, student athletes will be exempt from the course beginning on January 1, 2016.

Section 3: According to the Mayo Clinic, a nonprofit medical research group in Rochester, Minnesota, drugs can have a variety of different side effects. They include, but are not limited to, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart problems, psychiatric disorders, and halted growth.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow random drug tests for all middle and high school students participating in competitive extracurricular activities, however, drug testing is not a requirement. A study in 2012 indicates that drug testing is primarily effective at deterring substance use for students in school. 

Section 5: When signed into law, the first drug test will occur at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year.

A Bill to Re-Fit Kill Shelters to No-Kill Fostering Shelters

BE IT HERBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: Animal shelters that regularly euthanize animals do so as the result of overcrowding.  This bill exists to present a sensible and manageable alternative to euthanizing animals by requiring spaying and neutering animals and implementing fostering programs to encourage more widespread adoption of rescue pets. 

Section 2: In order to prevent any initial overcrowding and unhealthy conditions for animals in shelters, this bill will give shelters a time frame in which they must convert from a "kill shelter" to a "no kill shelter" with a fostering program.  If passed, the time frame for this process will be from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2018.  After January 1, 2018, all shelters will have fully transitioned to no kill, fostering shelters. 

Section 3: In the case of animals who are ill or otherwise have reached the end of their natural life, shelters reserve the right to euthanize.  These cases, however, must meet an accepted set of standards for euthanasia so that the process is not abused. 

Section 4: Funding for this transition and any new shelters that are built as a result will come from a very minor property tax increase of .05%.  This small tax increase will be used to re-ﬁt and expand older shelters and potentially construct new shelters in areas of greatest need.  Charitable donation and volunteer work are expected to keep costs down. 

Section 5: If passed, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

With the passage of this legislation, schools would start at 9:15 am, increasing by 50 minutes, leaving schools to finish around 3:30 pm.   Section 2: The state's school systems will start at 9:15 am in the new Fall school year of 2017. Starting in the year 2017, will give time for the school administration to plan different time scheduling occurring from this change such as sport practices, and performing arts activities that take place after school.   Section 3: Because a law like this might affect parents in the mornings, we propose that the school faculty should be at school at 8:45 am. This can be used for academic help, and transportation of children in the mornings.   Section 4: This change in time has no need to add tax and no need for budget changes.   Section 5: When signed into law, this action will take place on the day South Carolina schools begin in the new Fall school year of 2017.

An Act to Increase the Minimum Wage in South Carolina
						
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA]
						
Section 1: As of right now, the minimum wage in South Carolina is $7.25 per hour which would be increased to $9.00 per hour.
						
Section 2: The minimum wage would be increased by 25 cents per year over a span of 7 years. This means that by January 1, 2023 the state minimum wage would be $9.00 per hour.
						
Section 3: In South Carolina right now, a person making minimum wage and working the standard 40 hour work week cannot afford to pay for a two bedroom apartment. This would help people who make the minimum wage better support their family.
						
Section 4: A raise in the minimum wage would result in:
	•	Less poverty
	•	People having an easier time supporting their family 
						
Section 5: When signed into law, the first 25 cent increase will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act for High Schools to Require Basic First Aid Training
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: In South Carolina there is currently no mandatory education of basic first aid skills. The added tax on emergency transportation {EMS vehicles} and donations could help fund students to become First Aid/CPR/AED certified.
 
Section 2:  The added tax will start at 0.02% on January 1, 2016 with an annual increase of 0.02% for 3 years. Thus, the state tax on emergency transportation would be 0.08% by January 1, 2019.

Section 3:  Since emergency transportation vehicles are privately owned, the owner will have to pay this tax on their earnings to the government. Because some ambulance businesses only collect about 30-40% of what they charged, or they get little business, and they have to pay for all of the equipment including the vehicle, some businesses may not be able to afford to pay this tax. Businesses that can prove they give an average of less than 2,000 necessary emergency rides annually can have a reduced tax of only 0.02%.

Section 4:  Revenue from this tax and donations would fund:
	•	The funding for teachers to become certified and trained to teach the course;
	•	The funding for certificates for the teachers after they have completed the course, so they are now qualified to teach students

Section 5:  When signed into law, the first increase will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act for Installation of Water Bottle Fountains in Public  

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1:  The current state bottled water tax is 0% so to decrease the usage of plastic we will raise the tax by 3% each year to increase by 6 cents per plastic bottle.

Section 2:  The state tax should increase by 6 cents each year during the course of five years.  By January 1, 2020 the state tax for plastic bottles would amount to at 125 cents per bottle. 
 
Section 3:  By adding water fountains to public bus stops, we would be adding an additional place to refill water bottles. Through this idea, the environmental issue of plastic waste would be solved with the ability to continually keep a full water bottle. Also, it would support the less fortunate with a dependable water source.

Section 4:  Revenue from this tax would fund:
	•	Source of water at public bus stops
	•	Stations available to refill existing water bottles 
	•	More efficient recycling system 
 
Section 5:  Once confirmed, the first increase of taxes will be conducted on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Ban Biker Shorts

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: Almost all of bikers today wear tight biker shorts whether that being male or female. All bikers tend to like wearing tight clothing while riding their bike. Let’s be honest no one wants to see tight shorts like that. We believe children of all ages, especially younger kids, do not need to be exposed to such images. 

Section 2: Every time a biker is seen in biker shorts, a police officer can pull that biker over and give them a ticket of 15 dollars. The biker will be forced to turn around and end their route as soon as possible. After 5 tickets the biker will be forced to pay a 50 dollar fine and will lose all biking privileges until proper biking apparel is equipped.   

Section 3: All of the income from the tickets will go to under privileged kids to receive a new bike. All kids would love to learn to ride a bike, but some kids just do not have the chance. We believe that this bill can change all of that. 

Section 4: Revenue from this fine would fund:
	•	Provide bikes for kids who cannot afford a bike;
	•	Maintain state police bikes and equipment;
	•	Fund city and state police officers for upgraded police cruisers.

Section 5: When signed into law, the fines will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Allow Turkey Hunting During The Week Of Thanksgiving

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: In South Carolina, turkey-hunting season varies from region to region. There are different zones ranging from 1 to 4.  Zone 1-3, on private and wild life management lands, hunting dates are April 1-May 1. In Zone 4, private land, the dates are March 15- May 1 due to early nesting. The goal of this bill is to extend turkey hunting to the 3rd week of November. (The week of Thanksgiving) 

Section 2: This bill would allow each hunter 2 turkey tags at their request. The tagging procedure is required to go just like the spring season. Not all hunters will use both of their turkeys. Each hunter will be encouraged to donate his or her turkey to a local food drive. A local food bank will then distribute these extra turkeys. 

Section 3: If a hunter received tags in the spring of that year they will not be valid during the fall season. Each hunter must re-register for falls tags. Two tags will sold for $5.50 and all proceeds will benefit the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. 

Section 4: This bill would allow all turkey hunters who register the opportunity to hunt that week. 

Section 5: When signed into law, fall turkey season will be open in November of 2015.

A Bill to Control Motorcycle Parking

BE IT HERBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: Motorcycles should not be allowed to park in the larger parking spaces for regular cars because they only take up half the space. The remaining space of the parking spot is wasted, and could be used for another car. It should be illegal for motorcycles to park in regular spots because when a car is driving around looking for a spot, they don’t see the motorcycle, and try to pull into the spot. Due to the fact that motorcycles would not be allowed to park in regular spots, they would have their own special spots. This way motorcycles and larger motor vehicles would both have a place to park. 

Section 2: This law will be enforced by the local government to build and put the parking spots in place, and also by the police to ticket people when they break this law. 

Section 3: This law will be funded by the penalties for breaking this law, such as fines. Penalties for breaking this law will be a warning the first time, and a 50 dollar ticket the second time. Any additional offense will result in at least a 150 dollar ticket. 

Section 4: This law will be enacted January 1, 2016.

An Act to Make it Illegal to Tie Up Dogs Outside

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: The current policy for tying dogs up outside in South Carolina is “out of sight, out of mind.” In other words, people are allowed to chain or tie their dogs up outside as long as no one can see it or it is not a disturbance to anyone.

Section 2: The effects of chaining or tying a dog up for hours, days, or even longer is extremely damaging to the dog. Dogs are very social, so them being tethered for long periods of time can cause extreme psychological damage. This doesn’t only affect the dog, but also any humans or other animals that may come into contact with the confined dog. Dogs tied for long periods of time can become extremely aggressive because of the neglect and prove to be a threat to anyone around them. Some dogs even begin to have sores and cuts on their necks from tight-fitting collars or from trying to escape.

Section 3: The creation of this law would not affect the economy in a negative or positive way.

Section 4: Anyone found with a dog tied up on their property will receive a warning. However, if they do not change the dogs’ living situation, the owner will then receive a $200 fine. If the owner is caught with the dog tied up a third time, the dog will be taken from the owner and placed into a better home.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will go into effect January 1st, 2016.

Section 4: The standard penalty for the murder of an animal would be 18 months in prison, a $1,000 fine, and an ownership ban on top of the other charges for animal cruelty.  This penalty is a guideline that can be adjusted by the judge based on the nature of the crime.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An act to reduce gentrification in the state of South Carolina.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Gentrification is the buying and renovating of houses and stores in deteriorated urban neighborhoods by wealthier individuals, which in effect improves property values, but also can displace low-income families and small businesses. 

Section 2: Low-income families can no longer afford to live in an gentrified area because taxes and incomes of property have tripled or quadrupled in size. 

Section 3: The effects of gentrification have a negative impact on the greater community: 
	•	when people are pushed out of an area and forced to live in low-income neighborhoods, they cannot obtain well paying jobs to afford the incomes and taxes because of a lack of a quality education. The government is supposed to provide a quality education for the people of the community, but alas this is not happening in many urban communities. 
	•	Cities become less diverse when families are forced to relocate. For example, Greenville's population has increased 10.3% from 2000 to 2010, but the African-American  population has plummeted by 8%. The same is true for the city of Charleston. Some neighborhoods lost roughly half of their black population in just one decade, starting in 2000. 

Section 4: Property values have seen an unreasonable increase. 
	•	Since 2005, single-family homes sold on the peninsula north of the Septima P. Clark Parkway sold for $170,000 or less. So far this year, half have sold for at least $325,000.
	•	Since 2000 homes in Nicholtown were worth less than $40,000, but now sell for $130,000+. 

Section 5: I propose we establish laws that nullify gentrification in urban communities. A state zoning law that orders for every 5 houses built, 1 of them is affordable. When a real estate company is selling houses in a urban neighborhood, a fraction of the houses for sale will be sold at a reduced price. This zoning law will be declared in gentrified neighborhoods all over the state of South Carolina. 
 Section 6: This will be funded by redirecting tax dollars from the construction of high priced buildings and centers, such as the Gillard Center in Charleston whose expenses are up to $200 million. These places are being bought with taxpayers dollars when the city could use this to fund affordable housing, quality education, and infrastructure that improves local communities. 

Section 7: In the long run, it will be more beneficial to the state if gentrification is nullified.

Harder Punishment for Domestic Abuse

BE IT HEARBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current punishments for domestic violence are community service, fines, anger management class, restraining order and sometimes jail. 

Section 2: The punishments need to have more jail time. There also should be lager fines and a more well-kept restraining order. There should also be a series of educational anger management.

Section 4: The goal of the more severe punishments: 
	•	The educational classes would be to try to break the cycles of people who have been abused in the past abusing people as they get older.
	•	The severe punishments would also try to protect more women from domestic abuse.

Section 1: Many Students on the state of South Carolina rely on buses to and from their school. This bill will be enacted to help students participate in extracurricular activities. 

Section 2: Today in the state of South Carolina has 700,000 students that ride the bus to and from the home. Many students do not have the ability to participate in extracurricular. My bill will make buses available for students that wish to participate in extracurricular activities. 

Section 3: Because students rely on buses, these students spend their afternoons free and are more likely to get in trouble on streets or in trouble when walking home from their activities. This bill will help students stay out of trouble when the students get rides home from extracurricular and have the option to participate. Studies show that students who participate in a sport or a club are more likely to perform better at school. This means higher test grades from South Carolina students; this means South Carolina will look better as a whole.

Educational Extracurricular Program Salary

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The coaches of school sports get paid a certain amount of money depending on the wealth of the school district. Teachers who run educational programs, however, are not given a pay rate for their efforts. Coaches do not get paid much, but what is given to them makes up for some of the time they have committed to coaching that sport. 

Section 2: Teachers do the same thing with these extracurricular organizations, but without pay. They set up the program within the school, select members to be in the programs, guide them on with what they need to do, take them on trips to learn from their experiences, and give up a lot of their personal time to educate students. What teachers do gives many students the perfect opportunities to see what options lay ahead in life for a career, and also teach kids simple but valuable skills that they can use over the course of their lifetime.
	
Section 3: The teachers will be paid the same amount that coaches are paid for their efforts, which depending on the wealth of the school district. The funds for this operation will come out of the school district. This will give teachers an incentive to get more involved in the programs offered, which will give more opportunities to the students as well. Also, this pay is a way to thank teachers for their hard work in leading these programs. Educational programs can be the only way some children get to see what opportunities there are out there for their future. This is why we need more schools to participate.  Teachers will be more willing to help with this if they are offered extra pay for their efforts.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act for the mandatory labeling of pesticides and herbicides used in the growing and processing of all food products.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: 	By the probable passing of this Act, many families of South Carolina will become aware of their consumption of GMOs and will come to terms with the health factors of the consumption of these products. 

Section 2:	As of 2010, 80% of all packaged food in the US contained GMO ingredients. All of which are said to be unsafe. Yet many individuals have no clue what they are consuming, many of which are in grave danger for taking in something that is leading them to plenty of hidden health risks.

Section 3: This law is for the mandatory labeling of the pesticides, herbicides and any hidden ingredients that have been and continue to be used in the growing and processing of the foods we all consume daily. This law should very well be printed on any packaged (whether it be individual or not) food items. This includes a mandatory 12pt. font, and the font type of Times New Roman.

Section 4: Following the enactment of our probable proposal, it is our right as citizens and human beings, to be fully aware of what we are ingesting. By passing this Act, we can insure that these things may very well be improved:
	•	The majority of Americans should be proved healthier and more cautious of the type of chemicals going into their body. 
	•	Young children should no longer be at risk of taking in unknown herbicides and pesticides that are infused in GMOs.
	•	The exposure of knowledge to all and any Americans will be increased, which, will then give those Americans the opportunity and personal choice to control their GMO intake.
	•	The safety of our country will be improved and increased, which is most definitely in the best interest of South Carolina.

An Act to Increase Tent Cities in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state capital used to address South Carolina’s homeless will be significantly increased, as in some cities the budget is only enough to address about 16 percent of the homeless population. 

Section 2: With the current budget of South Carolina cities, there isn’t enough money in the budget used to address homeless people. Currently, there aren’t enough shelters and tent cities to house all of the homeless. 

Section 3: Because of the amount of homeless people that aren’t able to live in shelters, an increase in tent cities and shelters would not only be a solution to provide housing for the homeless in South Carolina, but would also help with South Carolina’s “Emergency Homeless Response, “as there wouldn’t be many homeless people sleeping in downtown cities because they’d have shelter.

Section 4: The expected results from this act would be:
	•	More care for the homeless in the state of South Carolina;
	•	More effective way of achieving the solution proposed in the “Emergency Homeless Response;”
	•	Decreased arrest rates for homeless people as there would be fewer homeless people in the downtown areas of South Carolina cities.

	•	The amount of money spent will be used more wisely;
	•	All high school students, before they graduate, will be able to budget and know how to spend their money;
	•	It could lead to happier families and lower the divorce rate.

An Act to Allow Media Access to Police Camera Footage

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Justified or unjustified, police brutality is becoming a serious issue all around our country. The line between justified and unjustified becomes blurred by biases from both sides, leaving citizens dazed and confused. The best way to judge between defense and brutality is to view the event from the officer’s perspective with body cameras. On June 10th, 2015, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley signed a bill requiring body cameras on every police officer in South Carolina. However, the Freedom of Information Act denies public access to these recordings. 

Section 2:	 The purpose of spending $23 million over the first two years is to allow the media to see what is really happening from the police officer’s point of view. Statistics show that 52% of police officers admit to turning a blind eye when a fellow officer commits “improper conduct.” By allowing access to full-length videos from boy cameras, crimes can be viewed and the actions of officer and criminal may be judged. 

Section 3:	 This law will make all video from body cameras available to media and the public under the Freedom of Information Act. This will help to unite our state and to allow us to see what happened before judgment is dealt. 

Section 4:	 If a police officer or department fails to comply with this bill and releases footage from body cameras, mandatory suspensions and investigations will follow. 

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill shall take effect after 50 days.

Section 4:	 Our bill will protect individuals who are gay and feel like they are in a violent relationship that the law will not protect them from.

An Act to Lower the Legal Drinking Age to Eighteen

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1: People who are under the legal drinking age as of now and their caretakers. 

Section 2: Lowering the legal drinking age to eighteen years old would provide help for making the environment that young people drink in to be safer and more controlled. 

Section 3: The intentions of this bill is to lower the drinking age from 21 years old the 18 years old. This would lower the accidents caused by being intoxicated in young adults. At the age of 18 people are legal adults, can fight in wars for our country, and buy a house, yet they can not buy a beer on their own. Many countries that have the legal drinking age set at 18 have far less drunk driving accidents than the U.S. Lowering the drinking age would also stop the thrill of young adults participating in drinking because it would be illegal. 

Section 4: We expect that that intoxicated related accidents will decrease in young adults due to the controlled environment most of them will be drinking in. This bill will ultimately make drinking with young adults safer and more controlled.
