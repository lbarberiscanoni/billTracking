An Act to prevent the Guantanamo Detainees from being moved to South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: To date, Guantanamo Bay has held 780 detainees since 2002. 64 of the 116 that remain are deemed to be some of the most dangerous international terrorists known at this time, and therefore are not foreseen to ever be released. President Obama has requested to close Guantanamo Bay prison, and transfer the detainees to United States soil to reduce the defense budget. The state of South Carolina must not be an option for the relocation and housing of the remaining detainees. 

Section 2: By January 1, 2016 the former U.S. naval base, located in Charleston, South Carolina, must not be considered a sufficient relocation option due to many factors notwithstanding safety and security concerns within the community of Charleston as well as the state as a whole. 

Section 3: Knowing it may be more costly to keep the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, the priority of our government should be to protect its citizens. Therefore, the detainees should remain in their current, remote location.

Section 4: Not authorizing the transfer of these detainees to South Carolina would:
	•	Protect the safety and well-being of all current and future South Carolina citizens;
	•	Prevent negative financial obligations that would be burdensome on the state of South Carolina;
	•	Prevent South Carolina from being a future dumping ground for international detainees.

An Act Concerning Maximum Price for Necessary Pharmaceuticals

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Section 1:  There are no current limitations concerning the prices for necessary 
pharmaceuticals, an act like this would make it so that any pharmaceutical which 
makes over a certain threshold in revenue needs to be evaluated by an established 
committee to determine the maximum price on life saving drugs. 

Section 2: Limiting the maximum price of life saving pharmaceuticals will prevent a 
drastic increase of pharmaceutical prices. This price cap will ensure a just 
pharmaceutical price for those economically vulnerable. 

Section 3: Because the market for over-the-counter drugs is very large, and the 
supply for said drugs meets the demand, there are not many pricing issues, therefore, 
over-the-counter drugs, and medicine not related directly to health, are exempt.

Section 4: Potential gain from this bill:
	•	Affordable prescription drugs;
	•	Decrease in people trying to make money off of drugs that could be sold for less.

Section 5: When signed into law, the first pharmaceutical evaluation will take place on January 1, 2016.

An act to revoke South Carolina public colleges application fees.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section1: Many students in South Carolina are required to pay an application fee to apply to public colleges within the state. By the time students have applied to at least four to six public colleges they have paid at least three hundred dollars. The high cost may be prohibiting students from applying to more than one college. This bill will allow students to apply to more than one college and not worry about the application fee.

Section 2: Currently the students in South Carolina have to pay an application fee for most colleges they want to apply to. Repealing the fee on public colleges applications will encourage more students to apply to more than one school. Also it will encourage students to apply for in state schools because it will lessen the economic burden. Application fees are a barrier to getting an education and this bill will decrease the barrier between the students and their education. This bill will encourage all students of all social classes. Those that are of lower income will benefit from being able to apply to a greater variety of colleges so that they may choose the best financial and educational option for them. The voucher system for low income students that is currently in place is not enough of a financial incentive, by making the applications free these students will be encouraged to apply to a greater number of colleges, therefore increase their odds of getting into a better school with better financial options.

Section 3: The State Government should fund the money for application fees through the South Carolina State Education Lottery. The money from the lottery will be split between two-year colleges and four-year colleges.

Section 4: We will enforce the bill by making public colleges allow students to apply for free. The Government of South Carolina will be the ones to enforce the bill. If the state colleges fail to comply with waiving state student’s application fee, their state funding will be revoked.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

SUTA Flat Tax Proposal


BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This act would incentivize South Carolina employers to hire more employees because it would reduce the SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act) each employer has to pay per worker.  This act would reduce the SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act) tax rate to a flat and reasonable 1% with no drop-off after gross earnings capped after $200,000 per year versus $14,000. Introducing a flat tax would encourage increased employment on the part of businesses because the varying rates of the SUTA tax rate (0% - 7.855%) discourage higher numbers of employment. This is because whenever a business hires an employee, there is a possibility that said employee would have to be laid off at some point in time, causing the SUTA rates to go up for that particular business. 

Section 2: The problem of a varying and raised SUTA tax rate has been a detrimental encumbrance upon businesses for 7 years, and has cost businesses not only opportunities for growth and expanded employment, but has also cost businesses in South Carolina nearly a billion dollars due to SUTA Dumping (see Section 3). This problem's solution is in the form of a flat SUTA rate of 1% imposed on companies corporately held in South Carolina, as oppose to the average 3.91% rate. Another piece to this solution is imposing a slightly raised 2% flat SUTA rate on companies corporately held outside of South Carolina, such as Boeing or BMW. These flat and low tax rates will not only encourage corporations to relocate to South Carolina, but will reduce the amount of money lost due to SUTA dumping because the costs for SUTA dumping will outweigh the cost of actually paying the SUTA rate. 

Section 3: A major issue with the current system of imposing SUTA rates is SUTA dumping. SUTA dumping methods are ways that employers avoid a higher SUTA tax rate or the raising of their SUTA tax rate. Ways that businesses do this are Corporate Shelling and using the New Employer Rate. Corporate Shelling is when a company transfers its payroll to the purchased entity, essentially moving all taxable payroll assets to a new or undeveloped entity with a much lower SUTA rate. The New Employer Rate is when a company files a registration form requesting a new employer account number (Federal ID Number), essentially resetting their SUTA rate. These methods are the two primary methods of SUTA dumping, which create an uneven playing field amongst businesses and costs the state hundreds of millions of dollars annually. 

Section 4: The bill would essentially fund itself, as the money gained from increased taxable assets would go towards the state and in turn to DEW (The Department of Employment and Workforce), which enforces and upkeeps SUTA. 

Section 5: DEW (The Department of Employment and Workforce) will enforce the bill, and is currently paid for by the state employers, which would see an influx of revenue due to more corporately held taxable assets within the state of South Carolina. This surplus that our state would come into would allow for further expansion on the part of the state, thereby allowing more legislative acts to be passed and funded. 

Section 6: This bill would affect business in South Carolina in a tremendously positive way. Not only would the cost per-employee drop significantly, it would encourage outside business to migrate to South Carolina. It is no secret that companies like BMW and Boeing have brought major employment to South Carolina, and their influence on the state's economy has been conspicuously positive. The amount of similarly sized corporations that are present in the state would only increase, as South Carolina would be a place where businesses have real breathing room and can expand throughout the state, creating jobs and opportunities for all South Carolinians. 

Section 7: This bill will take effect on January 01, 2016.

An Act to require a background check before purchasing a firearm. 

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: On June 17th, 2015 there was a terrible tragedy that took place in Charleston, South Carolina. A 21-year old man shot ten people in a church, and nine of them died. Prior to this shooting, the gunman already had a criminal record. If this bill went into effect before this incident, this tragedy may have been able to be prevented. Our bill will require any person that wishes to purchase a firearm pass a mandatory background check. 

Section 2: The general idea behind background checks is to check individuals for any criminal or public safety record to prevent them from owning a firearm. We believe that this is legitimate because the state should not allow people with certain mental disabilities and public safety charges to possess firearms. Some may view this as interfering with our 2nd Amendment rights, the right to bear arms, but it is for the greater good and should reduce crime rates in South Carolina. A new study from Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research has found Missouri’s decision to repeal its law, requiring all handgun purchasers to pass a background check, led to a 16 percent increase in the state murder rate. People purchasing firearms would have their name run through the National Instant Criminal Background Check or NICS. Some may argue that the government cannot tell people which products they can and cannot buy, but this is also for the greater good of the public and if someone passes the background check, there is no reason they should not be able to purchase a firearm. 

Section 3: Funding for the background checks will come from an additional 1% tax on the purchase of firearms and ammunition. A statewide background check typically costs $10-20. Background checks are not free, but are cheap and easy to do. 

Section 4: Individual vendors will enforce the stipulations of this bill. If this became a law, they would be legally obligated to run background checks. If someone fails a background check then there will be no repercussions for those attempting to purchase a firearm. Appeals can be made if someone has a criminal record for a nonviolent charge (drug possession, minor in possession of alcohol, etc.). Appeals would be submitted to the NICS Section’s Appeal Services Team and/or the state branch of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).

Section 5: This bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Lighten the Stress Level of Students

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  As students in South Carolina, we previously and still currently undergo multiple levels of stress due to the overwhelming number of assessments. We feel that a major cause of this is having multiple examinations for multiple subjects in one day. For example, a survey conducted for the American Psychological Association, proves that 83 percent of teens said that school was “a somewhat or significant source of stress.” This bill is an attempt to reduce the level of stress on teens by permitting only one examination from each subject once a week. Basically each subject will be assigned a specific day to conduct examinations aka tests and quizzes.

Section 2:  As mentioned in section one, we are highly concerned about stress on students.  Students stress out over there grades. Our bill will fix this problem by allowing more time for students to study. In the state of South Carolina, all public schools will follow a certain examination schedule. A rough draft of the basic core subject schedule is: Mondays will be math days, Tuesdays will be science days, Wednesdays will be social studies days, Thursdays will be related arts day, and Fridays will be English days. This schedule does not include students taking more than one class in the same general subject, that can be determined by the specific school. Furthermore, this schedule allows students, teachers, and parents to be more organized as well as remain healthy, balanced lifestyles. However, if there is a need to make up any examinations that a student missed, then the make-up assessment can be taken on any day of the week, as long as it is prearranged with the teacher. Also, if there are days missed sue to national holidays/breaks and or bad weather (snow days) then teachers will be allowed to assign assessments any day on the prior week or the current week, as long as students have a two day noticed. We understand that teachers want to assign assessments whenever because they want to test our knowledge. Although, from a student perspective, it takes more time to fully understand the material so that it can help us in the long run. Specifically, students can focus on studying in one subject, instead of studying multiple subjects at once, as well as receive more time to study, so that it can be useful in real life.
Section 3:  Our bill does not need to be funded, because all it takes is communication and enforcement. Once a final schedule is in act, teachers will then be left to plan lessons and examinations around a specific day. If the teachers don’t follow the instructed schedule and assign examinations on their unassigned day, then students will be allowed to retake the same test on the upcoming assigned day. 

Section 4:  This bill will be enforced by the State Board of Education in South Carolina. Once this is put into place, the bill can be further enforced on a local level by districts.

Section 5:  When signed into law by the governor this bill will take place on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to delay the starting time of public schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill would change the current start time for all SC public high schools to 9:45 and change the end time to 4:45.  Studies show that, on average, teenagers need nine and a half hours of sleep to perform at their highest level of ability in school. Not getting enough sleep leads to an inability to listen, concentrate, and solve problems, which are basic activities that you are expected to be able to do on a daily basis in any learning environment.  On top of this, many kids have extracurricular
activities after school. This is also very difficult for individuals who take classes that
come with heavy workloads at night, such as honors and AP classes. From these reasons, we concluded that for students to get enough sleep to function at their maximum ability, the school starting time should be later.

Section 2:  We propose that school should start 1 hour later, at 9:45 am. Pushing the school start time back one hour makes up for the time difference between that average time and the amount that students should be receiving. If school starts at 9:45, that would push back the end time to 4:45pm. This time is convenient, as most parents have jobs that end around that time. With this start time, the average individual would wake up at 8:00am, rather than 7:00. This means that the average kid that goes to bed at 11:00 will get 9 hours of sleep, which will enable them to be able to better perform their daily tasks at school. With this new start time, students will not be as tired during classes, and they will likely be able to better concentrate and absorb the information they are being taught. This not only helps the students, but will also help the schools. With kids having a better ability to learn, it is only logical to assume that they would then get higher grades. With higher scores on tests, quizzes, and state/national assessments, schools would be much higher looked upon.

Section 3: Unlike most bills, this bill can be put into effect without any additional funding.  It would involve altering teacher contracts to allow them to work at different times.  It would also change school bus schedules and cafeteria schedules, but it would run like a normal day, simply pushed back an hour.  That would mean there is no need for extra funding.   
Section 4: The South Carolina Board of Education, the main governing body of all public schools in South Carolina, will put this bill into effect for all SC public schools.

Section 5: Our bill will go into effect the beginning of the 2016/2017 school year.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to prevent the abuse of welfare

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Welfare is a program that is designed to help provide the basic necessities for people living in or below poverty. Welfare is paid for by taxes. Unfortunately, this program is often abused by many people to purchase illegal drugs. This Bill would only be implemented for those who are receiving need welfare, not Medicare; the reason for this is because more people on welfare abuse the help they receive than on Medicare.

Section 2:  In South Carolina, we have roughly 38,000 citizens on welfare. However, there are no laws that require an applicant to be subject to mandatory drug tests.

Section 3: Drug tests for every recipient of welfare would have an estimated cost of $500,000 per month. Therefore, if a 53% tax increase on cigarettes was imposed it would provide the cost of the tests. A 53% tax increase is equivalent to a 30 cent raise.  

Section 4: The proposed law will be enforced by:
	•	A signed contract with the recipient stating that he or she is subjected to a monthly drug test while receiving welfare and accepting the penalties of the three strike system.
	•	A three strike system will be implemented to insure welfare program will not be abused.
	•	The first strike will be a written warning that will go on a permanent record.
	•	The second strike results in the size of their check will be reduced for that month.
	•	The third offense will result in the termination of the recipient from the program. They will be permitted to reapply to the program after six months has passed.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Prevent the Homicide and Abuse of Women 

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently, South Carolina is second in the nation in the number of women murdered by men, only recently being surpassed by Alaska for the number one spot. The state has been in the top ten on the list for the past decade and topped the list three times in this period. Over the last ten years, more than 300 women have died at the hands of a man in South Carolina. As far as domestic violence, 36,000 cases are reported annually in the state. And too many times murder and domestic violence are related. The state has done little to nothing to help either of these problems, as is illustrated by a steady homicide rate of women by men for the last 15 years. This bill will drop these frightening statistics by inflicting harsher punishments on abusers, and providing more ways for the victims to get help and feel safe. It will also lower the rate of women killed by men, as it would stop these men before they get to the point of killing their victim, as well as moving women to do something earlier because they know their state cares and wants to what’s right to keep them safe. 

Section 2: Right now, in South Carolina, someone convicted of domestic violence has to be convicted three times before they are charged with a felony. On a first or second offense, they can be fined and put in jail for as little as thirty days. So after a month in jail, what is stopping them from returning to their old habits of abusing their victim(s)? This constant abuse is what leads the abuser to eventually commit murder. 

Section 3:  Right now, in South Carolina, domestic violence is not a priority. Funding for this bill would come partly from sales taxes, but mostly from state funding. We need more ways for these women to get help. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough resources and domestic violence shelters (right now, 46 counties in this state have animal shelters, while only 18 have domestic violence shelters) for every request to get the help they need. Of the victims that don’t get help, about 60% return to their abusers. The state would pay to build more shelters that provide care for domestic violence victims. This would include opening shelters in half the counties in the state that don’t have them, as well as increasing the funding towards the preexisting shelters so that every plea for help can be met. Taxes from sales tax and property tax would go to any costs related to imprisoning the accusers. 

Section 4: We need stricter laws with stricter punishments for domestic violence crimes, so that women can finally feel free from the constant cycle of abuse they suffer through. Local Law Enforcement can enforce this bill by extending the amount of time in prison convicts spend and charge them on their first offence, not third. The cost for holding the guilty accountable would not be that large, but any additional costs involved in detaining and punishing the accused would come from taxpayer dollars. 

Section 5: This bill will be beneficial to our state for the following reasons:
	•	It will contain people who commit domestic violence.
	•	It will provide protection and safety for women who are victims of domestic violence.
	•	It will decrease the amount of deaths and domestic violence rates committed in our state.

Section 6: When this bill is signed into law, it will be taken into effect on January 1st, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Improve Our Roads

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The poor condition of South Carolina roads has caused at least one fatality and numerous injuries, along with car repair bills from blown tires, dented rims, and broken windshields. One reason that South Carolina has bad roads is because South Carolina has the fourth-largest state maintained road system in the United States, but the third-lowest gas tax to pay for the maintenance. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) has to maintain over 40,000 miles of roads, but South Carolina politicians rarely raise taxes. The state’s gas tax of 16 cents a gallon hasn’t been raised since 1987. South Carolina has some of the lowest gas prices in the country. We propose to add an extra 5 cent tax per gallon to help increase the quality of our roads. Though this amount does not seem much, it starts to add up. This will cause people to spend money on gas instead of car repairs which will save people money in the long run.

Section 2: 47% of the roads are considered to be in poor condition and 19% are considered to be substandard, according to fixscroads.com.  The average cost to repair a flat tire is $10 and this does not include the cost to repair dented rims or broken windshields. With damages to cars these amounts start to add up to a lot of money because of the poor roads that we are driving on. 

Section 3: There will be no need for funding for this bill as the tax will be added to the price of gas. This law will be enforced by every gas station in South Carolina. the penalty for the gas stations who do not enforce the law will be penalized with a fine of two thousand dollars every week they don't enforce the tax.

Section 4: The benefits of this bill are: 
	•	We will have better roads. The tax will give SCDOT the money to improve the roads. 
	•	Cars will not get as beat up because of bad roads. This will help people not have to spend as much money on repairing their vehicles. 
	•	With better roads, SC will be able to attach more businesses, as quality infrastructure can be a key component for whether new businesses decide to open in SC, thus creating more jobs. 

Section 5: This bill will be signed into law and take effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Return Bottles and Cans

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently there is not a law in South Carolina that requires its citizens to recycle.  This bill would place a 15 cents tax per aluminum and/or glass bottle purchased in SC.  Examples of these items are soda cans, water bottles, beer bottles, and wine bottles or wine cooler containers. The revenue generated by this tax will be distributed as follows:  five cents to the store for collecting the recyclables, 5 cents towards funding public education in SC, and 5 cents towards improving SC roads.  

Section 2: Currently in South Carolina recycling is optional. Either participants pay taxes for it to be picked up (for example those who live in the city limits often pay higher taxes, but receive recycling) or citizens take it to a landfill or recycling center.  This law would incentivize all stores to purchase machines that process recyclable material in order to obtain the 5 cents return on each bottle/can.

Section 3: The law will be overseen and enforced by the SC Department of Revenue who will distribute monthly checks to stores, the department of education, and department of transportation based on the amount of recycling received.  The recycling will be collected by the non-profit Palmetto Pride and any expense associated with the collection and drop off of recycled items will be taken equally out of the revenue generated prior to organizations involved being paid.

Section 4: The justification for such an Act follows:
	•	The state recycles 29.2% of its recycled waste. Because of this in effect in other states, there have a higher recycling percentage. For example, California’s population recycles 49%, Delaware is 40%, Michigan is 31%, and Vermont is between 30-35% 
	•	The roads in South Carolina are in terrible condition and the schools need to be improved so this new revenue source could help improve to important aspect of SC.  There are similar affective acts in other states such as California and Michigan.
	•	South Carolina generates about 4.2 million tons of trash in landfills each year. Inmate crews have picked up over 368,000 pounds of litter.

Section 5: The benefits of this bill are as follows:
	•	The funds from this bill go to the store (five cents), schools and education (five cents), and to help improve the roads (five cents).
	•	This bill will help the environment and it will incentivize people to want to improve the environment.
	•	It will also help reduce the amount of waste generated.
	•	Stores who choose to participate will get more customers.
	•	It would keep parks and roadsides cleaner.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Require All Abortions be Conducted Only When the Life of the Mother is at Risk.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Many women are faced with the difficult decision of receiving an abortion. Although there are many other options to consider about the fetus’ life, terminating the pregnancy is always a choice. To reduce the occurrence of abortion, a law should state that the mother must have a deadly condition that requires the need for the pregnancy to be terminated for the mother to survive, in order to receive an abortion.

Section 2:  The bill will state that the mother needs to have a life-threatening condition to execute the abortion. If the mother’s life is at stake and will die because of the fetus a trained doctor at an abortion clinic, hospital or private practice is allowed to abort the fetus. If the abortion is by medication the woman must have a prescription to obtain say Mifepristone. In South Carolina it is required that an abortion clinic has a license in order to practice abortion. Abortion clinics or any practice executing abortions will have to obtain a new license with a requirement to meet the new standard of only practicing on women with deadly circumstances

Section 3:  In South Carolina public funding is already provided for abortion in pregnancies endangering the mother or that are a result of rape or incest. Rape and incest no longer will qualify the mother for an abortion. Without the need for the funding for rape victims or incest the funds previously provided for rape and incest will go to Department of Children and Family Services and Department of Health and Environmental Control.

Section 4:  The bill will be enforced by the Department of Children and Family Services, OB-GYNs, Physicians, and any doctor taking part in the abortion. Doctors would be required by law to recommend or perform an abortion only if it is absolutely necessary for the mother to survive. If a doctor is found guilty of approving of the disposal of a fetus without need the doctor will be faced with criminal charges. If the mother is denied an abortion due to not meeting the medical requirements, then DSS will offer the mother adoption options and other places for the child to go once born.  The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control would enforce the requirement by requiring facilities to have on record every abortion and proof of a doctor’s approval. If the facility is unable to provide the necessary information then the Department of Health and Environmental Control would then be able to be shut down the business.  If any doctor or mother is aware or taking part in an unapproved abortion and neglect telling a government official, then they are to be punished according to the extent of the actions.

Section 5:  This bill will go into effect January 1st, 2016.

An Act to Lead to More Death Row Executions in SC

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: This bill would enforce a time limit of one year from the date sentencing to the date the state execution must take place.   Specifically, a person who receives a guilty verdict and is sentenced by a jury of his/her peers to the death penalty will only have one year to appeal his/her case before the state goes through with its execution.  The current state death penalty law states that the death penalty can only be enforced when somebody has knowingly created a great risk of death. Crimes that typically receive death penalty punishments are rape and murder.

Section 2: The purpose of this bill is to reduce the tax payer burden of keeping a convicted criminal alive when that criminal has already been given due process of the law and received a death penalty conviction.  There has been only 72 executions since 1979, there has only been 1 person executed in the past five years in SC. There are currently 44 people on the South Carolina Death Row being held in the Broad River Correctional Institution. It will cost approximately 17,600,000 these 44 people alive on Death Row in 2015. 

Section 3: This bill would be funded through the savings collected by not keeping as many convicted criminals on death row.  These additional funds would pay for the chemicals and experts who preform state executions. 

Section 4: The Law Enforcement courts will enforce the implementations of the new South Carolina Death Penalty Law.

Section 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016 after the youth governor signs it.

An Act to REQUIRE ALL TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES TO BE MARKED

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: All traffic enforcement officers’ cars will be required to be marked so that any civilian will without a doubt be able to identify the officer. Any police officer assigned to traffic enforcement will be required to have a fully marked car.  The side doors and the hood of the police car need to bear the agency's badge or the city seal, as well as emergency telephone numbers. This will not affect law enforcement such as detectives.

Section 2: The purpose of this bill is to help with traffic flow and the continuous issue of speeding on busy roads. When civilians are able to identify a police officer on the road, they tend to slow down. This will help cut the amount of wrecks caused by speeding.

Section 3: The required markings of each car will be provided by money gathered from state highway taxes.

Section 4: Requiring marked cars will not only help to identify officers, but will cut down on the amount of civilians speeding. A representative of the state will follow up on their assigned city police department to confirm the upholding of the law. Reprimand for not upholding the law will be determined by the representative.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Establish a Hate Crime Law in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
Section 1: A hate crime is defined as a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, or national origin. Examples of hate crimes:
	•	Physically assaulting someone while using derogatory racial, sexual, etc. words
	•	Vandalism or “hate” graffiti directed toward a group where it will be seen by members of the targeted group
	•	Commission of arson to a facility owned by the targeted group
This bill will increase the punishment for a hate crime fueled by hate or prejudice.
Section 2: Currently in South Carolina there is no law that increases the punishment of a crime fueled by prejudice. Moreover, the existing laws do not effectively protect and dignify the victims of the crime and members of the afflicted community. The latest crime statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2013, asked agencies in every state but Hawaii, plus Washington, D.C., to report hate-crime statistics to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. South Carolina had 51 reported hate crimes, ranking the 34th highest rate out of the participating 49 states. Most law enforcement agencies are not required to report hate crimes to the FBI, so several other transgressions may be going unreported.
Section 3: This will be enforced by the state Department of Criminal Justice and local law enforcement. The statutes outlawing types of bias-motivated violence or terrorization are as follows:
	•	Physical injury, emotional suffering, loss or damage suffered by members of certain groups
	•	Any person who suffers physical injury, emotional suffering, damage to or theft of his or her property has a just cause of action to intensify the penalty against the person who caused the physical injury, emotional suffering, damage or theft.
	•	Illicit damage to religious and other property or possessions
	•	Any church, synagogue, mosque, or building used for religious purpose.
	•	Any school or educational center associated with a particular race, religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, or national origin.
	•	Any personal property
	•	Use of combustible materials and/or explosives in attempt of arson
Section 4: In the event that the crime is proven to be motivated by hate, the assigned enhanced punishments are as followed:
	•	Physical Assault
	•	If crime committed is first degree the revised maximum sentence under this section is 12 years in prison
	•	Includes injury caused by sexual assault, commission of a theft, and an assault. 
	•	Likely to produce death or immense bodily harm
	•	If crime committed is second degree the revised maximum sentence under this section is 4 years in prison
	•	Assault results in moderate harm to the body sometimes requiring medical treatment
	•	Sexual assault
	•	If crime committed is third degree the revised maximum sentence under this section 6 months in prison
	•	Referred to as a simple assault/ misdemeanor
	•	Slightly injure or attempt to injure
	•	Vandalism/ Damage of Property
	•	Malicious Injury/property damage- punishment depends on damage value
	•	$5,000 or more- up to 12 years in prison
	•	1,000 to $5,000- up to 7 years in prison
	•	Less than $1,000- up to 2 years in prison
	•	To place of worship- sentence of 10 months to 12 years in prison, depending on severity
	•	Illicit graffiti containing racial, sexist, religious, derogatory slurs
	•	Fine- $1,500 up to $4,000 depending on severity of offense
	•	Potential Jail Sentence- 150 days up to 4 years in jail
	•	Arson

An Act to Teach High School Students About Domestic Violence

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: All public schools will be required to introduce a three part domestic violence curriculum within grade ninth to twelfth year, during a health or PE class. Domestic Violence is a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence. Other terms for domestic violence include intimate partner violence, battering, relationship abuse, spousal abuse, or family violence.
 
Section 2: The purpose of this bill is to educate students about domestic violence in order to reduce the domestic violence rate. Safe Harbor, a supporter of this bill, is a special program in South Carolina for victims of domestic violence, helping, sheltering, counseling, and supporting them. Currently, there is no policy for a curriculum for domestic violence, which is why it needs to be taught among the teenagers.
 
Section 3: The curriculum for the three part domestic violence curriculum will be provided by the state department of education. The domestic violence curriculum will be taught through the health and physical education classes, when the student takes a health or physical education class. The curriculum will be taught for two weeks to prevent interruption of other gym priorities. Students should learn in the curriculum to tell an adult if domestic violence occurs, know what domestic violence is, and ways to prevent it from happening.
 
Section 4: Domestic Violence is a continuous growing problem in the state of South Carolina, and it must be addressed to our teenagers to help decrease the percentage. South Carolina is the second state in the nation with the highest percentage of men killing women. 
Section 5: The domestic violence curriculum provided by the state department and the program Safe Harbor. The classes will equal three one hour units which will be taught one hour for three consecutive days. If students take this class, who are not in a PE or Health class, they will be allowed to have special privileges, with the guidelines of the student’s school. Although this is not a required grade to graduate, it is a required grade to pass a PE or health class. Also, learning about domestic violence is a must among teenagers, and it will help benefit their knowledge and decrease the domestic violence rate.

Section 6: This bill shall go into effect August 18th, 2016 upon the passage and signature of the Youth Governor.

An Act to Reduce Minority Bias in Law Enforcement

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Minority bias is an ongoing issue in society. Law enforcement officers have large responsibilities when dealing with alleged offenders, so it is important that officers don’t exhibit racial bias towards anyone.  Training to reduce racial bias by police could play a crucial role in reducing the impact of prejudice on possible arrests. 

Section 2: As of 2008, African Americans and Hispanics comprise of 58% of the prison population, while only making up a quarter of the U.S. population.  Training to reduce racial and minority bias in law enforcement will bring awareness to unconscious bias that many people, including law enforcement possess. Officers with no previous refractions and are experienced with at least ten years of experience will provide said training, along with sociocultural psychologists. 

Section 3: In order for the anti-bias training to go into affect, ticket fees would provide funding. Per officer, the class would cost $200 to go through one, six-hour course.  Classes would provide officers with realistic scenarios and the constant reminder that bias is not always intentional, but can be prevented through understanding its repercussions. 

Section 4: This specialized minority bias training will be a requirement in order to become a part of law enforcement.  Upon receiving an infraction due to suspected minority bias, said law enforcer must repeat the training.  

Section 5: This bill will go into effect on January 1, 2016.

Motorcycle Helmet Law

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: An act to make riding a motorcycle illegal without the use of a helmet. There has been a safety problem in South Carolina with motorcycle accidents. Our bill is to help the safety of a motorcyclist and save many lives. This bill will make the safety of a rider much greater than it was before.

Section 2: More than 80 percent of motorcyclist crashes result in injury or death to the rider. The statistics show that helmets reduce the risk of death to a motorcyclist by 37 percent. Helmets also have been statistically shown to reduce head injury by 69 percent to the rider. The United States saved $3 billion dollars due to the helmet use in 2010 due to less deaths and crashes to clean up.  Also, if all riders would have worn helmets, the United States could have saved an addition $1.4 billion dollars in 2010. However, helmets do not reduce visibility or impair hearing. (iihs.org)

Section 3: This bill will not have to have much of a fund. The only fund would be that riders would have to buy helmets at their own expense. If a rider chooses not to wear a helmet then the rider will be breaking the law and possibly face future tickets, fines, and/or jail time.

Section 4: This bill will be enforced by law enforcement in South Carolina. The offense of not wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle would be a ticket enforced by police officers. The result of not following this law could result in heavy fines and possibly prison time. The first time will result in a $500 fine. The second offense would result in another $500 fine and 30 days in prison. Any other offenses after this will result in jail time determined by a judge.

Section 5: This bill will go into effect once signed by the governor at the date of June 8th, 2016.

An Act to mandate a Study Hall period for all High Schools in South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:	Currently, in South Carolina, it is not a law for all high schools to offer a study hall period.  The option to study periods for high school students are regulated by the individual district.  This bill will give students who have not failed a class and are on to graduate a chance to implement a study period into their schedule.  

Section 2:	The current time for each class of 50-55 minutes would be lowered to 45-50 minutes per class.  Study hall will be offered as an elective so if you are not qualified for the study hall option, you can choose a different elective or course for that 35 minute period.  A 35 minute study period would give students many opportunities and advantages such as; 
	•	Time to catch up or get ahead on any class work and/or homework.
	•	Time for studying.
	•	Time to work on projects or essays, which is extremely helpful to those without computer access at home. 
High school students that participate in extracurricular activities or afterschool jobs, will be able to get work done rather than staying awake all hours of the night and cramming.  

Section 3:	Our bill will not require any funding because an administrator will supervise the period. 

Section 4:	If, by an administrator advises that the given study period is being abused, it can be taken away or suspended from the student.  

Section 5:	 This bill will be signed into law and take effect in August of 2016.

An Act to Allow Limited Licensing of Gambling in Horry County, S.C. To Benefit Roads and Schools in the Entire State

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  The state of South Carolina tends to have a bad reputation for their public school system and their roads. The state’s public school system continues to be very lowly ranked in their percentage of high school graduates in the country. Also, there are many dangerous roads in this state that have been the cause of a lot of fatal car accidents. With gambling legalized, a lot of money will become available from the casinos, which will then be donated. Roads and the public school system are not the only things that will benefit from the money; a small portion of the profits will also be donated towards helping people with gambling problems, just as the lottery does. Horry County’s established infrastructure for tourism will support limited gambling operations in the state of South Carolina. If gambling becomes legal in only part of state, it will end up benefitting the state more than hurting it.

Section 2: With the bill, a state commission will be established with five members that are appointed by the governor of South Carolina. The Commission will establish the rules and regulations of operating a casino as well as the application and approval process for issuing licenses. Each member will serve a 2-year term on the Commission before being reappointed or replaced by the governor. With the casinos open, 45% of the gambling taxes will go towards building better roads in the state, 45% will go towards the public school system, and the remaining 10% will fund programs that help people that have gambling problems. 

Section 3: 5 percent of net earnings from gambling operations will pay to the Commission by the casino companies with approved licenses. The casinos themselves will fund to build their casino with the other 95% that they earn from people coming to gamble.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to Educate Adolescents on Their Citizens Rights

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Teens in South Carolina are unaware of their own rights that they possess as being young adults, such as privacy and search and seizure rights and invasion of privacy rights. This bill would enact the requirement of a teen completing 1 class session annually in high school educating teens about their rights.

Section 2: High schools in South Carolina will be required to schedule the 4 hour class once every weekend throughout the year.  This allows ample opportunities for students to take the required class when it best suits their schedule.  There are at most 35 students per class. The first 2 and a half hours of the class will focus on explaining the necessary content via PowerPoint, while the remainder of the time would be for 30 minutes review session, 30 minutes of study time, and 1 hour for a standardized 50 question assessment, requiring at least 35/50 score to pass the class. If a student fails, then the class must be retaken at the reduced price listed in the 3rd section. The class would be taught by a local policeman who has the certification to take the class.  Once a student has passed the class, he or she would be given a certificate for passing, and the school would document their passing on the student’s transcript, as this class will be required to graduate from a South Carolina Public School.

Section 3: The cost of manufacturing the standardized PowerPoints and tests and educating the teachers would be accounted for by requiring a $65 fee in order to take the class each time, similar to paying for taking a DMV driving test. If a student qualifies for free or reduced lunch at school due to the economic conditions of their family, they can pay for the class at a reduced rate of 25$, which can be payed in 2 separate amounts- when the student first signs up for the class in advance and when they arrive on the actual day to take the class. Also, if a student fails the class, they will retake the class at the reduced price of 25$. 

Section 4: This bill will be enforced by schools, requiring students to take this class by the end of their senior year in order to graduate.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An Act to make animal testing illegal

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Animals should not be used for scientific and/or commercial testing because it is using up more money than it would if we tested these products with alternative methods.

Section 2: Alternative testing methods now exist that can replace the need for animals. For example, human cells from volunteers can be used for scientific and/or commercial testing of products. Artificial human skin can be made from sheets of human skin cells and is grown in test tubes. This can produce more useful and reliable results than animal testing. Scientists can experiment with human cells obtained from volunteers. They can use artificial human skin that is grown in test tubes using human skin cells. They can use virtual models of human molecular structures and predict the toxicity of substance. Another reason why human cells should be used instead of animals is because drugs that pass animal tests aren’t always safe or reliable. The last reason why we should not test on animals is because it is wasteful. Scientist put harmful chemicals on innocent animals. Either the experiment works or it fails, but what happen if it fails? They just throw the animal away! 

Section 3: Many non-animal tests, such as Vitro, have been compared to animal tests. Vitro has been proven to cost a lot less than animal tests. Vitro is the type of experiments that uses artificial organisms rather than animals that gives back even better results. For example, “a rat phototoxicity test” costs $11,500 but a Vitro test costs $1,300. These artificial organism tests would save a lot of money, enabling scientists to conduct more tests and experiments. About $15-16 billion of taxpayer money goes toward animal testing which is the money that would go towards funding our bill since it will no longer be needed for animal testing. Those that do continue to conduct tests on animals will have these punishments conducted by the USDA:
	•	1st Offense: $50,000 fine
	•	2nd Offense: $100,000 fine
	•	3rd Offense: 6 months in prison (judge decides on bail amount)
	•	4th Offense: 1 year in prison (judge decides on bail amount)
Section 4: The SC Department of Agriculture is in charge of and is enforcing the animal welfare act in South Carolina and would also be in control of making sure no products are tested on animals in the state of SC.

Section 5: When signed into law, this bill goes into effect on January 1, 2016

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED

An act to prohibit schools from starting class before 9:00 AM.

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: There are currently no laws that require a later start time for students. Early start times are causing students to lose hours of sleep and leading to exhaustion.

Section 2: This law would lessen sleep deprivation in teens and promote a more focused learning opportunity. Early start times prevent the students' brains from waking up and cause loss of focus and concentration. Teens need around 8-10 hours of sleep each night to function. A study from National Sleep Foundation showed that only 15% of teens get 8 1/2 hours of sleep on school nights. 

Section 3: Schools will change their normal scheduling to begin class at 9:00 AM and will continue with the normal hours of school from before. 

Section 4: Schools that continue to begin before 9:00 AM will be temporarily shut down while a new schedule is organized. This will be monitored by the South Carolina Department of Education. 

Section 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016 and will be enforced at the beginning of each school year.

An Act to have 3% of Tax Income Decreased for Veterans

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The state of South Carolina has a significantly high population of veterans who have fought for our country and our freedom. Through this bill, a percentage of income tax for veterans, both retired and medically discharged, will be lowered.

Section 2: Veterans transitioning to civilian life already have difficulty with obtaining stable and profitable jobs. However, this bill will assist veterans with their financial struggles, help them provide for their families, and if medically discharged, could help them recover from post trauma or fear from previous duties. This bill qualifies for South Carolina state residents only. This bill does not apply to veterans dishonorably dis-charged. 

Section 3: Veterans will be granted a card that, when it is presented and validated, will allow them to receive 3% off income tax. Cards will be charged at 7$ and veterans must apply and fill out a form under South Carolina Veterans Association and South Carolina department of Revenue in order to obtain and clarify the use of said card. The cards will have a special stamp on them so that the government will be able to verify that the card is real and not fraud. Anyone caught using a fraudulent card can be convicted with fraud charges and will result in criminal punishment by law. 

Section 4: South Carolina office of Veterans Affairs will reach out to veterans and tell them about the card. They will also help guide them through the paperwork process be-tween the SC department of revenue.

Section 5: When signed into law by the Honorable Youth Governor, this law will go into effect January 1, 2016.

An act to raise the pay of women to the same amount that men are being paid

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Men and Women are not being paid equal amounts currently in the United States. Women would have to work 60 extra days just to earn what men did by the end of the previous year. On average women get 75¢ for every $1.00 that a man gets. This bill is imperative in today's world.

Section 2: This bill would help raise the amount of money that women would be getting from their jobs. The three top jobs that pay women less then men are Health Technicians, Counselors, and Pharmacist. These are often typical jobs had by women. This bill will help the women of today. It will show people that men and women are in fact equal.

Section 3: This bill will enforce equal pay for men and women. It will raise women's pay so it is equal to the amount of money than a man gets paid. Companies and businesses will help enforce this law. 

Section 4: If companies/businesses fail to comply, they will be fined maximum of $5,000.  This money will come from the company/business.

An Act to Nullify Capital Punishment

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

SECTION 1: This Bill will eliminate the option of assigning the death penalty to convicted criminals and others sentenced to death by the court of law. 

SECTION 2: All criminals who are already on death row shall still receive capital punishment. 

SECTION 3: The death penalty will be replaced with life in prison, without parole. 

SECTION 4: The court can also sentence criminals to life in solitary confinement.

SECTION 5: Some believe that life in prison will cost more than capital punishment, but that is not true. In South Carolina a single death penalty case carried out to execution costs taxpayers an average of $1.1 million more than life without parole. A single death penalty trial, not going to execution, costs approximately $415,240 more than a non-capital murder trial.

SECTION 6: If passed, will go into effect January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED 

An act to decrease sentencing time for non-violent ownership drug crimes

BE IT HEARBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current law for ownership of Marijuana states that the possessor will face up to 30 days and a 200 dollar fine for a first offense. The current law for ownership of any psychedelic drugs for a first offense is a 5,000 fine and up to two years in prison. The current law for ownership of drugs such as math, cocaine, and crack says the possessor will face up to a 5,000 fine and a minimum of three years in prison. This new act would cut fines in half for all first time offenders, as well as prison sentences.

Section 2: This year 19.8% of all arrests in South Carolina have been drug related, and 17.6% of our states prison population were arrested for drug crimes. This would decrease prison population and the state deficit towards the South Carolina Department of Corrections. 

Section 3: This bill would not affect subsequent offenders for the aforementioned crimes. Psychedelic drugs include drugs such as LSD and DMT. The current fine, 5,000 dollars, would be minimized to 2, 500 dollars. When this bill takes effect, all people charged will have their fine reduced to 100 dollars, and a maximum sentence for first time offenders would be 15 days. All first time offenders of the math, crack, or cocaine would be given a year and six month sentence, and pay the cine of 2,500. These decreases will not affect anyone currently facing time for first time possession crimes.

Section 4: With a decrease in prison population, lower amounts of our tax money would go to the South Carolina Department of Corrections. Not only would this decrease our state deficit toward the Department of Corrections, but in time a surplus would be created, which this surplus would go to:
	•	Rehabilitation programs for drug addicts in our state penitentiaries
	•	Education budget

Act to Reform Requirements Needed to Receive Food Stamps
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state requirements to receive food stamps as a single able-bodied person without dependents are as follows:
	•	Applicant must receive 1,276 dollars of monthly income or less. 
	•	Able to show proof of citizenship or documentation showing lawful residence in the U.S.
	•	Provide current/recent health insurance, housing, and utility expense information.
	•	Resource information such as bank accounts, vehicles, homes, property, insurance, etc.

Section 2: This state reform would add a requirement to receiving food stamps. This requirement would include either volunteering for six hours per week, attending a state job training course, or working 20 hours per week at a paid job.  

Section 3: By implementing this bill, money would be saved due to the fact that many people would not comply with the work requirements. In Maine, where this bill has been put into place, 78% of the people who were on food stamps had been removed. If this were to happen in our state, then there would be a significant decrease in food stamp participants. The purpose of this bill is not to completely remove all food stamp participants, but to eliminate the dependency on the food stamps. By putting in place these work requirements, there is no longer a dependency on food stamps.

Section 4: The gained revenue from this bill would go to:
	•	The increase of job training centers/fairs.
	•	The availability of public transportation to rural communities. 
	•	The South Carolina Education fund.

Section 1: The current state government does not require the possession of permit to purchase a firearm, and the registration of the purchased firearm afterward.

Section 2: Prior to obtaining the firearm, the purchaser must fill out a permit application form with the local or state government.

The initial fee for the firearm permit will be $50, and every 6 years afterwards it must be renewed with a fee of $25. 

Section 3: The purchased firearm must be registered with local law enforcement within 4 days to record the ownership of the firearm. To register a newly purchased firearm, the buyer must provide a completed application for firearm registration. Part of the application must be completed by the seller. 

Section 4: To purchase a special case weapon, which include but is not limited to:
	•	Shot guns 
	•	Sawed/ Off rifles 
	•	Hand grenades 
	•	Assault weapons

buyers need a 30-day license. The issuing of these licenses will be similar to the process of issuing permits. A license application must be completed, along with a background check and a safety test. The licenses will be issued by the state government.  

Section 5: Current gun owners are required to obtain a license and register their firearms once this bill goes into effect. The normal processes will be completed as if the firearms are newly bought. The deadline is a week after the bill will go into effect, and will be punished with a continuing fine of $2,000 every week after the deadline.

Section 1: Stipulations - In line with the federal government’s College Promise Act. When eligible students apply for federal grants to community colleges, this bill ensures that the state will cover the remainder of their tuition for two years. This bill will seek to assist in the growing demand for a highly educated workforce with college degrees. The bill will:	
	•	appropriate funding on a federal/state ratio of 75/25
	•	promote South Carolina as a national leader in educating and promoting an educated prepared workforce
	•	preemptively mitigate financial disadvantage as a factor for not attending college

An Act to Repeal Ban on Traffic Cameras

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Traffic Safety Cameras would be put up at red lights in the state’s three largest cities, Columbia, Greenville and Charleston, to catch illegal activity of drivers. These cameras would take a picture of the driver's license plate and the driver of the vehicle and send them a ticket for running the red light.

Section 2: This would promote greater awareness of traffic safety laws and encourage better driving habits, making driving safer for others. Collected fines, in turn would benefit and fund the state government with more money to spend towards traffic safety and or roadway improvement.

Section 3: $1,500,000 worth of funds previously used towards School Bus Lease and Purchase could be used instead for the installation of Traffic cameras in major cities in South Carolina. Traffic cameras would be used for ticketing unsafe drivers. A 50% of the money gained from tickets can be used for roadway improvement and the other 50% back towards other state funds.

Section 4: Income from this program will benefit the State in the following ways:
	•	Improved traffic flow on crowded and rural areas by creating new and more efficient roadways.
	•	Road repair and improvement will reduce the amount of damage done to vehicles through unsafe road conditions.
	•	Create jobs for people that are qualified for work in the field of traffic safety and construction.
	•	Improve overall safety of drivers due to the knowledge of possible tickets because of traffic cameras.

Section 5: When signed into law: cameras will be put up in their respective areas by January 1, 2017.

An Act to reduce Domestic Violence

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Domestic violence is defined as: A pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner.  Domestic violence can be physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person.

Section 2:  The current policy for a reported case of Domestic Violence gives the victim of the Domestic Violence the choice of whether or not to prosecute their abuser.  This would be changed, so that the abuser is always put on trial.  Essentially the case cannot be ‘dropped’ by the victim.

Section 3:  This bill is needed because many current cases of Domestic Violence are being dropped by the victim, even though there is sufficient evidence to prove the abuser guilty, mainly for economic reasons (not economically independent). However the victims’ well being is more crucial than their financial standings.

Section 4:  This bill will decrease the amount of cases of Domestic Violence because in a lot of Domestic Violence cases the violence continues and can escalate to more serious actions after the case is dropped by the victim, meaning if abusers were punished earlier when the situation was first reported, the victim's abuse would be relieved earlier.  

Section 5:  When signed in to law, this policy will be put into place January 1, 2016.

An Act to Require Restaurants in South Carolina to Give Leftover Food to Homeless Shelters 

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Restaurants in major South Carolina cities, such as Charleston, Columbia, 
and Greenville, would be required to make available all leftover, uneaten food to 
homeless shelters.	

Section 2: Restaurants are throwing away almost 50 million pounds of food a day and 
33.7 million tons of food per year is being wasted. If the national food losses could be 
reduced by just 15% it would save enough food to feed 25 million more hungry 
Americans.  There are over 6,000 homeless people in South Carolina. Restaurants in 
South Carolina waste about 131,937 tons of food a year.  

Section 3: This proposal would require restaurants in major South Carolina cities, such 
as Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville to make available all the leftover, uneaten food 
that they have at the end of the day to a homeless shelter. Shelters will be responsible 
for transporting the food either by using volunteers or through existing vehicles owned 
and operated by the shelter. Funding for this will come from donations. 

Section 4: This proposal will help:
	•	Cut down on restaurant food waste
	•	Feed the hungry in South Carolina

Section 5:	When signed into law, restaurants would start donating their food on 
January 1, 2016.

An Act to Increase the Number of College Graduates

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current GPA required for a college student to maintain the LIFE scholarship is 3.0, would be decreased to 2.5.

Section 2: The lowered GPA of 2.5 would allow more students to graduate from college that would otherwise consider dropping out of college when they lose their scholarship. This will increase the amount of citizens in South Carolina getting their degree and getting higher paying jobs.

Section 3: Many schools in the state of South Carolina do not properly prepare students for college. South Carolina landed 37 spots on the list of the top 100 worst schools in the Nation. When students that attend these schools that don’t properly equip them with the skills and knowledge to be successful begin college, they quickly lose the 3.0 GPA that got them the scholarship. These hardworking students are then in danger of losing the $2,500 scholarship given to them for their good grades. Without this scholarship, many students have to   out of college because they no longer have the finances to pay for college. By lowering the GPA to 2.5 we give these students a little room to make mistakes and get the feel for a college workload. More students will be able to keep the scholarship this way which will increase the number of college graduates in the state of South Carolina.

Section 2: The state tax on beer and tobacco will be increased to 10%. 6% of this will go to tax and the extra 4% will go towards scholarships so, we as a state provide greater educational opportunities to our citizens.
Section 3: The scholarship money will come from the new percentages we put on tax. Though tobacco and beer products will increase in price, our education will better from it by giving back some of the money we put on those those items and putting them on scholarships.

Section 4: The increase of this tax will provide the following benefits:
	•	Scholarships to students who might not be able to afford college otherwise.
	•	A more educational work force which will attract more companies to locate in South Carolina. This in turn will provide more high quality jobs for South Carolinians.
	•	The increase in the tax will also help in bringing jobs to South Carolina, because the people will be better educated and have a stronger work ethic.

Section 2:	An estimated 5,000 to 13,000 people are homeless in South Carolina. This

An Act to Require the Use of Protective Headwear for Motorcyclist

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: South Carolina currently does not have a law that enforces the use of 
protective headwear (helmet) for all motorcyclists. South Carolina does have a law that 
says that motorcyclist under the age of 21 are required to wear protective headwear 
but all ages should be required to wear protective headwear.

Section 2:	Enforcing this policy will decrease the number of injuries and fatalities 
involved in motorcycle accidents. Helmets decrease the severity of head injuries and 
the likelihood of death. The federal government estimates that wearing a helmet 
reduces the risk of dying in a crash by 37 percent. Unhelmeted riders are 3 times more 
likely than helmeted ones to sustain traumatic brain injuries in the event of a crash 
according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Section 3:	Wearing protective headwear will reduce the fatality rate in our state. This 
policy will protect the motorcyclist and passenger(s). In 2013 motorcycle helmets saved 
1,630 lives. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) says that if all 
motorcyclists had worn helmets, 715 more lives would have been saved. Helmets are 
estimated to be 37 percent effective in preventing fatal injuries for motorcycle riders 
(operators) and 41 percent effective for motorcycle passengers according to the 
Insurance Information Institute, Inc.

Section 4:	 Protective headwear will lessen the damage done to the head in motorcycle 
accidents by:
	•	Preventing brain trauma
	•	Protecting the skull from being fractured or broken
	•	Preventing spinal cord injuries

An Act to Change the Grading Scale

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The state grading scale would change from its current state to a ten-point 
grading scale; for example instead of an “A” requiring an average of a ninety three or 
above, a ninety or above would be required to achieve an “A”.

Section 2: This new grading system will significantly reduce the stress that is applied 
to South Carolina’s students as well as making it easier for new students to transfer 
their previous grades from other states.

Section 3: The Grading Scale would change to:
	•	90-100
	•	80-89
	•	70-79
	•	60-69
	•	0-59

Section 4: Students would achieve higher grades and transferring to schools in South Carolina would be easier. Students in this grading scale will also find it easier to achieve a 4.0, seeing as only a ninety is needed to achieve an “A” or 4.0.

Section 5: When signed into law, the grading scale will go into effect with the 2016-2017 school year.

                   An Act to Make Maternity Leave Mandatory In South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:	All employed pregnant women in South Carolina would be granted 
maternity leave.

Section 2: Current South Carolina State Human Affairs Law prohibits employment practices that discriminate based on gender, including discrimination dealing with pregnancy, and all medical issues related to it. It states that the employer has to provide the same leave benefits to every employee, no matter their disability. This means that as long as all employees are treated equally, the employer is not technically required to grant maternity leave. There is no law that gives the mother time to recuperate from childbirth.

Section 3: For the state of South Carolina, maternity leave would be required for all employed women that are with child. The leave would include three weeks before the child’s due date, and up to eight weeks after the delivery, depending on the healing rate of the mother’s body.

Section 4: By granting mandatory leave:
	•	Expecting women would not have to work late into their third trimester of pregnancy, decreasing the likelihood of medical issues.
	•	The mother’s body would have time to fully heal after childbirth.	

Section 5:	When signed into law, maternity leave will begin to be a required policy on January 1, 2016.

A BILL TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR MOTHERS

Section 1: Any citizen or permanent resident with health insurance who visits a doctor before the fourth month of their pregnancy is eligible to receive a maternity package from the state. These packages will be funded under the social security administration, specifically through revenue made off a football “bowl game” hosted in Columbia, SC.

The package promotes prenatal checkups as the mother will have to visit a doctor to receive the package. It encourages breast feeding and environmental awareness by using sustainable materials such as the cloth diaper. It also encourages mothers return more quickly to activities they enjoyed prior to the arrival of their newborn. Countries with similar programs have seen a dramatic decrease in infant mortality rates. The package serves as a parents’ first promise to their child, as well as one from the state to the parent, that they want their child to have a good life. 

Section 3: The Maternity package will be a lined box with a lid made out of recycled materials, the box will double as a crib. It will contain the following items: Mattress, mattress cover, duvet cover, two gender neutral bodysuits for each season, a hooded bath towel, toothbrush, baby thermometer, diaper cream, washcloth, baby soap, cloth diaper, teething toy, picture book, three letter word book, world map, one bottle, one pacifier, a swaddle blanket, and a carry sling.

OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  The current immigration documentation costs approximately $2,000 per person this would be lowered to $1,000 per person.
                         
Section  2: The average income of a unauthorized immigrant is $36,000 per year  person with a household of two working parents and three children the annual 	       expenses of living would be approximately $58,627 per year allowing only 	   	       $13,373 of extra revenue a year and with documentation costs of $2,000 per person that would make the costs of documentation $10,000, which is a 	  	       unreasonable amount. Thus, by January 1, 2016 the cost of documentation 	 	       would be decreased to $1,000 per person making it a more reasonable amount 	       for immigrants.

Section 4:  The decrease in documentation costs will allow immigrants to afford U.S citizenship and decrease the number of non taxpaying illegal immigrants.This would allow illegal immigrants that were not paying taxes because they 	  	       were unauthorized citizens to pay taxes every year thus adding the 	    	   	       government funds to pay for this reduction in document costs.

Section 5:	When signed into law, the first decrease will take place on January 1, 2016

An Act to Allow Sibling Rights in Blended Families

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  	The current law states that siblings that share non biological parents are not allowed to see their brother or sister following a divorce.

Section 2:	The new law would state that children with non-biological parents would have sibling rights and would be able to see their brother or sister under the following circumstances:
	•	The child is old enough to understand the situation
	•	Recommended Age:  Approximately 10-12 years old
	•	Would have to be evaluated on a case by case basis
	•	Supervised visits would be available, but not required if the older
silbing demonstrates responsibility.
	•	Ex: In order to have unsupervised visits with a sibling, neither child can have an abusive background (drug, sexual, physical, mental, and verbal). Neither sibling can be diagnosed with a mental illness.

 Section 3:	Siblings that are old enough to drive would be allowed to transport the child.  The child could also be transported by a friend or another family member.  DSS would coordinate the visit provided all parties were found to be responsible.  (No abuse, drug, alcohol, criminal background.  No mental illness)
	•	If concerns were found, visits would be held under the supervision of a DSS officer at the DSS office, park, restaurant, ect., but at the request of a child (age 12 & meeting requirements) visits could be scheduled.

Section 4:	Currently in the state of South Carolina, there are many families affected by divorce and/or living with a blended family.  Thousands of children are placed into foster care each year.  This bill is needed because in the case of divorce, blended family siblings have no rights to see their brother/sisters when the non-biological parent will not allow it. 

Section 5:	When signed into law, the first visitations will take place on January 1, 2016.

An Act to Eliminate State Income Tax
BE IT HEARBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE
OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current income tax of 3% to 7% would be eliminated.

Section 2: The point of this bill is to attract people and businesses to South Carolina and also to help residents of South Caroline keep their money that they earned.

Section 3: With state income tax eliminated, sales tax would change from 6% to 7%. The upper class people who make more money will still spend their money on luxury items allowing the state government to still get their money lost from income tax. There would be no sales tax on food so the new bill doesn’t not put a bigger burden on the lower class.

Section 4: Elimination of this tax would cause:
Section 1: More businesses and more people would move to South Carolina creating  more jobs;
         Section 2: More money in people’s pockets;
        Section 3: More people have money to spend which helps businesses.

 Saving Families Act


Section 1: The United States federal government said it would like to accept more refugees in the following years. This program will outline a set of guidelines to create safe envrronments for these refugees to stay.

Section 2:  In this program , citizens who agree to house a refugee, or a family of refugees will be considered a host family, and will receive $13.70 a day per adult, and $6.85 a day per child to provide the necessities needed for the refugee(s) .

Section 3: In the saving families program, it will provide the necessities to refugees. Citizens of South Carolina can volunteer to house a refugee , or a family of refugees. The citizens who agree to house and provide for the refugees will receive $13.70 a day per adult, and $6.85 a day per child. That totals to $2500 for a six month period per adult, and $1250 for a six month period per child. The United States State Department is allowing 85,000 refugees in 2016 entrance into the United States, and last year 2050 refugees located to South Carolina, so based on these numbers this program helps to increase the number of refugees located in South Carolina to 3000 refugees in 2016 and future years. The employees needed to run this program will be hired and paid for by the South Carolina Department of Human Services. The money host families are given to provide for the refugees will be funded by the South Carolina lottery. To become a host family the citizen will have to go through an extensive background check, and prove they have healthy living conditions, necessary transportation , and financial stability. A host family will be provided government money for six months, and are expected to house, and care for the refugee(s) for six months, after that amount of time it is up to the family whether or not to continue care for the refugees. A prospective host family must also go through 14 hours of training, where they will learn what is expected of them, and what specific care they need to provide.


Section 4: This program will promote legal immigration  to  the  United  States, and create a sense of community  in South Carolina.  This state will promote legal immigration by creating a safe and easy way for refugees to come to South Carolina, and to help them acclimate to America 's society by living with Americans. The intent of this program is to be run by the counties of South Carolina, and just to be funded by the government.

	Section 5:	When signed into law, the saving families program will begin on January 1, 2016

POST-SUPER BOWL HOLIDAY
An Act to Establish the Monday Following the Super Bowl as a Public Holiday BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The public schools and workplaces of South Carolina will recognize the Monday immediately following Super Bowl Sunday as a public holiday, and therefore not having mandatory attendance.

Section 2: The NFL Super Bowl is one of the most watched televised sporting events globally. Following the Super Bowl, workplaces undergo unplanned absences from their employees, making the costs for those absences about 50% more expensive than those of planned absences. Any employees that do end up present at their workplace the Monday after the Super Bowl end up incredibly distracted from work, either because of discussing the events of the night before, or being hungover. Students that stay up late and go to school the next day will be sleep deprived, and also most likely to discuss the game. Hence, they will not be able to mentally focus on any of their subjects.

Section 3: Making the Monday following the Super Bowl into a public holiday will prevent any more costs for absences at the workplace. Research shows that out of 147.4 million American workers, 1.5 million are expected to call in sick on Super Bowl Monday , and 4.4 million could go in late. There would also be close to a loss of $170 million in productivity. These drawbacks would affect every state within North America. If the following Monday were made a public holiday, then the problem of unorganized and distracted work and school environments would be avoided, especially considering the already great loss of productivity.

Section 4: When signed into law, it will officially go into effect on the Monday following the next Super Bowl and continue to be in effect for every following post-Super Bowl Monday.

An Act to Allow Educators to Investigate Bullying Outside of School

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Currently in South Carolina there is no law protecting victims of Bullying abuse when bullying happens outside of the school. The new bullying law will protect and get justice for the victims and the victims’ families.   Bullying is defined as any unwanted contact:  physical, verbal, emotional, and including any bullying involving technology (text messaging, social media, etc.)

Section 2:	 The new law would stop and/or reduce bullying across the state of South Carolina.  The new law would raise the consequences for cases of bullying and when reported to a school official; it would allow educators to investigate bullying and report bullying incidences to authorities.  Current consequences are not effective in reducing and stopping bullying from occurring and school officials are not allowed to investigate bullying between students when it happens off school property.  The new consequences would be as follows:

	•	1st Offense – Attend Bullying Awareness Course (To be on school grounds, facilitated by educators and funded through grants and money collected from fines)
	•	2nd Offense – Community Service 
	•	3rd Offense – $1000 Fine
	•	4th Offense – Police Involvement – Criminal Charges

Note: If any other unwanted contact is made, or in severe cases, such as life threatening or violent offenses; the offender’s parents would be called and police would be involved immediately.  

Section 3:	 Bullying is killing students all around the world. 90% of deaths of students enrolled in schools are caused by bullying. Students won’t come to school because they’re scared of being harassed. By the age of 14, less than 30% of boys and 40% of girls will talk to their peers about bullying. 17% of American students report being bullied 2 to 3 times a month or more within a school semester.  Experts believe this number would be higher if all bullying incidents were reported. 

Section 4:	 Implementing harsher consequences will improve the school environment overall.

	•	Attendance will improve
	•	Students will feel safer knowing that bullying will not be tolerated
	•	Bullying creates tension and stress, and when this is reduced or eliminated students overall performance will improve.
	
Section 5:	When signed into law, the first consequence will take place on January 14, 2016.

An Act to Alter Requirements for a Beginner's Permit and Driver's Licenses

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section I: South Carolina’s Department of Motor Vehicles will be affected, and state roads and highways will be impacted.

Section II: Out of all males between the ages of 15-20, who had been involved in fatal crashes in 2012, 37% were speeding at the time of the crash and 25% had been drinking. South Carolina is ranked as the state with the highest fatality rate on the road. In addition, fatal crashes are the leading cause of death for US teens. Clearly, many young drivers are unlawful and unqualified to drive safely. Therefore it is necessary to keep unqualified drivers off the road and keep the road safe for qualified drivers.

Section III: A law shall be enacted that replaces certain 2015 requirements with new 2016 requirements for driving privileges, while still preserving all 2015 requirements not altered below.
	•	The knowledge test, required for a Beginner Permit, will be replaced by eight hours of classroom driver’s education which includes a test at the end of the course.
	•	The requirement of eight hours of classroom time for a Conditional License or Special-Restricted License shall be eliminated, since such training should already have been completed for the Beginner Permit.
	•	The requirement of a total of 6 hours will be increased to 10 hours of driving time with a certified driving instructor in order for a person to obtain a Conditional License or Special-Restricted License.
	•	As of 2015, a person must wait two weeks if he/she fails the road skills test once or twice. This new act will require a person to wait 30 days after the first or second failed attempt on the road skills test.
	•	As of 2015, a person must wait 60 days if he/she fails the road skills test after the first or second attempt. This new act will require a person to wait 180 days if the person fails after the first or second attempt.
	•	As of 2015, a person can obtain full driving privileges if he/she has had a Conditional License for one year and has not had any traffic offenses. With this new act, a person must retake the road skills test after obtaining Conditional or Special-Restricted privileges regardless of whether the person has already had a Conditional or Special-Restricted License for a year.

Section IV: Only the most qualified drivers will be allowed on South Carolina roads. The least qualified drivers will be kept off of the roads, which could reduce fatality on the road.

Section V: When signed into law, no one will obtain a permit or license after 2015 without completing the new requirements listed above.

An Act to Require All South Carolina Schools to have Epinephrine on Hand for Emergencies

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  Currently the law in South Carolina is that we allow schools to have epinephrine on hand.  In the 2016­2017 school year South Carolina’s public schools will be required to have epinephrine on hand in case of an emergency.

Section 2:  A person can go into anaphylaxis within minutes from exposure to an allergen.  If epinephrine is not in quick reach, the person's life could be in danger. 

Section 3:  The fastest way to administer epinephrine is through an EpiPen. This bill would require all South Carolina’s public schools to have one EpiPen per school.  On average these EpiPens are $100. We would require the individual schools to put the $100 in the schools budget to provide the money for the EpiPens.

Section 4:  On average this disease affects 1 in every 13 children under the age of 18 in the United States. That is roughly 2 people in every classroom. Requiring all South Carolina public schools to have an EpiPen on hand can save many children's lives. 

Section 5:  When signed into law this will take place on the 2016­2017 school year.

	•	 Discouraging people from purchasing non-organic foods

A Proposition to Cede the Territory of the State of Rhode Island to South Carolina and Convert it into a Province For Road Material Manufacturing for the State of South Carolina

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Rhode Island as a state has contributed next to nothing to the whole of the United States, and even less so to the state of South Carolina. Rhode Island’s size is insignificant, they’ve done nothing of historical importance, and they refused to send delegates to the Constitutional Convention – noting this, it is certain that few people would notice or complain about its disappearance. Considering our failing infrastructure and increasingly patchy roads, the state is in dire need of an improved infrastructure. Rhode Island, being a fairly useless area and already bearing the name “Rhode,” would be an incredibly useful site for manufacturing road-building material for the state of South Carolina. Therefore, it will be decreed that the state of Rhode Island will be annexed to South Carolina. 

Section 2:	 Following the annexation of Rhode Island by South Carolina, immediate destruction of all sources and documents referring to Rhode Island as ever having been an independent state will be decreed. All traces of Rhode Island as an independent state will be eliminated, and all former Rhode Islanders will be sent to psychological rehabilitation centers until they profess that there was never a state known as “Rhode Island.” The treachery of Rhode Island’s failure to send delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 will be avenged. 

Section 3:	 After full control over Rhode Island is realized, funds will immediately be redirected from unemployment subsidies to the purchasing of material for road construction. 

Section 4:	 All houses and public buildings in the former state of Rhode Island will be bulldozed and cleared for the construction of massive industrial factories to produce asphalt and paint for road construction.

Section 5:	 Once the aforementioned prerequisites are sufficiently met, construction on road paving factories will immediately begin. 

Section 6: The new, intensified asphalt production will mean a subsequent drop in costs for asphalt manufacturing, thereby making the repaving of our roads significantly cheaper and more efficient and would result in the establishment of asphalt production and road-paving as one of South Carolina’s largest industries (which, consequently, will mean thousands of new jobs for those out of work). 

Section 7: Upon the governor’s signature, this bill will become law on January 1st, 2016.

An Act to Alter the Grading Scale

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: The current state grading scale states that an “A” constitutes 100-93%, a “B” constitutes 92-85%, a “C” constitutes 84-77%, a “D” constitutes 76-70%, and an “F” is defined as any grade below 70%. The grading scale will be changed to a ten-point grading scale in which an “A” will be defined as 100-90% and a “B” will be defined as 89-80%. 

Section 2:	 The state grading scale will change to a ten-point grading scale in order to match the other 48 states and allow more accurate comparison.

Section 3:	 Because students in the other states have an unfair advantage over our South Carolinian students, they have a better chance to be accepted into better colleges. This bill will even the playing field for South Carolina students.

Section 4:	 The ten-point scale will also make South Carolina students’ GPAs appear higher and make these students more appealing to prestigious colleges. Even with high grades, South Carolina students GPAs do not seem as high. But the ten-point scale will correct this discrepancy between the states.

Tax on Cigarettes for Rehab Facilities

An act to increase the tax on cigarettes sold in South Carolina

Preschool Play Time

Why children can't sit still during school

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Many children are struggling from social and sensory details, even at such a young age. Recent studies show that children have been more recently diagnosed with ADHD. Some studies show that children are more likely to develop ADHD from the amount of time they are forced to sit still during school.

 
Section 2:  A resolution to this problem would be to give children a longer play time. Recess enables children to develop certain life skills, like communication and teamwork, that contribute to the fundamentals of having good social skills. 

Section 3:  Children need to have whole-body sensory experiences on a daily basis in order to develop strong bodies and minds. A preschool teacher observed her classes, and noticed that many children would fall out of their seats over three times a day, from being restless. Also children would run into walls and each other. To provide more recess, it would allow children to develop better social skills, a decreased chance of being diagnosed with ADHD, and no more children falling out of chairs, which teaches kids how to improve their focus and have a reduce in cognitive issues.
Section 4:  Benefits of this bill would include:
	•	Children would start their academic years with an advantage and will not be as clumsy, be more attentive and alert, more emotionally stable, and more socially competent.
	•	Having more playtime will also prevent cognitive and sensory issues later on in childhood.
	•	Prevents issues such as ADHD.
	•	It does not require a huge amount of money to allow more time for children in their preschool years to play more, but still have time to learn. 

Section 5:  When signed into law, the changes in schedule will take place on the first school day of the new year.

Section 3: The cost of bicycle injury and death is around $4 billion per year.

Section 4:  One mile of protected bike lane is 100 times cheaper than one mile of roadway, it costs around $445,000 per mile of protected bike lane, and $571 million per mile of roadway.

Section 5: By making 8,988 miles of protected bike lane per year it would be around the same price as the $4 billion sunk into bike and pedestrian/motor crash deaths and injuries per year.

Section 6: There are no protected bike lanes here in South Carolina.

Section 7: In the US there are about 8,656,070 miles of road, in South Carolina there is about 41,000 miles of road.

Section 8: If we create 41,000 miles of protected bike lane it would cost around $18,245,000,000 with a South Carolina population of around 4,832,482, if every month the taxpayers put in an extra $10 it would take around 30 years to finish all the protected bike lanes, and make South Carolina a better place.

An Act to Improve Domestic Violence Shelters

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: If domestic violence shelters don’t have programs to help victims become independent, they will be given 90 days to improve. 

Section 2: Funds will be allocated to shelters in order for them to create programs to benefit the health of victims.

Section 3: Domestic violence shelters that don’t improve within their time limit will be warned, and must improve and meet South Carolina standards for shelters.

An Act to Legalize the “Mistake of Age” Defense Pertaining to Statutory Rape

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Statutory rape is the act of consensual intercourse with someone who is not above age and someone who is the age of consent. The “Mistake of Age” law states that if the person accused of statutory rape was lead to believe that the victim was above the age of consent, that the defense can use this in trial. Several states have already taken the initiative to make the “Mistake of Age” defense, legal for the defense to use. 
Section 2:	As of October 2015, it is illegal to you the “Mistake of Age” law as a defense in court in regards to statutory rape charges in South Carolina. The law states that if the defendant was led to believe that the victim was the age of consent, which is 16 in South Carolina, then the law can be applied. If the person being accused of statutory rape was led to believe that the victim was of age, then the law can be applied as long as there is sufficient evidence to support this claim.
Section 3:	The “Mistake of Age” law has certain regulations and guidelines that must be followed/reviewed.

A Bill to Reduce Prices of College

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1: Colleges should provide funds to pay for housing, books, and a meal plan. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2014–2015 school year was $31,231 at private colleges, $9,139 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,958 for out-of-state residents attending public universities. Student debt in the US has reached $1.3 trillion and rising.

Section 2: The United States is losing well-educated students because of rising costs. Because of reduced costs in Europe, more than 4,600 US students are fully enrolled at Germany universities, an increase of 20%. These fees include $120 in fees and health insurance. American students are leaving the country just to go to a college where they know they will not end up in outrageous debt.

Section 3: The US wants everyone to have education, but not everyone has the money. Even if they do, when students off to college, they get in debt. If families cannot pay tuition, many intelligent and capable students will have to forfeit their education. 

Section 4: I think the US should pass a law that colleges should be free, or maybe lower the prices A LOT and so the professors and anyone who works at a college would still get paid. I think if they lower the prices then more people would come to college and that would help. We should look to Germany for an example. If the US had fair college prices maybe more people from out of the country would come to school here.

Allowing Cellular Devices

An Act to Provide Better Cell Service in Schools

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  	Currently, the majority of schools in South Carolina do not allow students to use cellular devices in class. We will be enacting a law to permit the use of mobile devices in schools during certain time periods.

Section 2:	 We will be lifting the ban of phones in school and eliminate the blockage of service during independent and group work to help students. 

Section 3:	 Though some may argue this will decrease student interaction and engagement in class, it will actually increase student involvement and push them to work more. It will reduce the amount of students being written up and kicked out of class for using their mobile devices, which provides them more time in class.

Section 4:	 Lifting the ban and allowing service will:

	•	Assist students with contacting parents in case of an emergency and access information on their devices.
	•	Allow students and faculty to use learning tools that involve mobile devices.
	•	Reduce the amount of mobile devices being taken and students receiving referrals for using them.
	•	Provide students with a set time in each class period (independent work, group work, and the any time not used for assessments or instruction) to use their phones and allow them immunity from referrals  relating to device usage during that time.
 Section 5: When signed into law, the bill will begin enforcement the 2016-2017 school year.

An Act to Provide a safe place for kids 

BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Section 1:  	Currently, parents of all ages are allowed to drop babies off and abandon them at churches, school, family members homes, hospitals, and other places.

Section 2:	 We will be taking that action away from the parent/family member to save the children from the many dangers of being left in the street in hope of someone finding them before death.

Section 3:	 Every year, thousands of children are left in poor conditions due to parents that are unable to properly care for them. We will decrease the amount of children that go missing, get hurt, or end up in foster care by making it illegal to abandon their babies. These things cause taxes to rise, many kids to be homeless, and the death rate of minors in South Carolina to heighten.

Section 4:	Save the lives of minors:

	•	Decrease the amount of minors that have been arrested for crimes due to no parental guidance or on the streets in gangs.
	•	Help maintain death rates relating to gang violence, teenage criminals, and poor health care among minors.
	•	Reduce the amount of adolescents that develop mental illness because they lack proper health-care or have experienced traumatic events such as being abandoned.
	•	Will be used to strengthen and re-enforce the Safe Haven laws.
 Section 5:When signed into law, the bill will begin enforcement the 2016 year.

An Act to Decrease the Amount of School Hours
 
BE IT HEREBY ENACTED BY THE YMCA MODEL LEGISLATURE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
 
Section 1: The average South Carolina public school’s school day is seven hours.
 
Section 2: This bill will decrease the number of hours in a school day to six hours.
 
Section 3: The school day, being as long as it is, puts excessive stress on young students. Some adolescents do not have the attention span or ability to retain information when presented in this manner. Children and adolescents, for example, with Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder cannot fully function at this rate. The decrease in school hours will give students time to relax and not feel as overwhelmed, therefore, likely decreasing the amount of high school drop-outs.
 
Section 4: Once in effect, not only will this take off some of the pressure off of school and decrease the drop-out rate, but it will give students the opportunity to join extra-curricular activities. These activities will engage students in problem-solving skills, teamwork, and good sportsmanship.
 
Section 5: This bill will take effect in the 2016-2017 school year.
