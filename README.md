## Description
This app helps [YMCA Youth in Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA_Youth_and_Government) programs manage the bill process of the conference. It does this by:

1. Building a universal form for students to submit their bills through
2. Allowing students and advisors to see in which chambers bills are in real time
3. Simplifying the clerking process for the clerks by removing any work they have to do beyond clicking a button if the bill passes or fails
